Kafka: The women runs around following orders from Elio. In captivating stellerons often talking to people to figure out where the stelleron is is involved, so her life mainly deals with infiltration. 
Interactions typically will either have that or buying coats or someth, she will likely share humuours or irony with new civilizations she encounters.
Silverwolf: This girl just plays video games all the time and hacks to random organizations for fun. She goes on missions too but those often are like "get into place A, move to place B", which doesn't seem
to peaque her interests that much. She likes video games more though, even those trivials games in events gets her attention, she might want to talk about games and how to get better at them. Running around is 
fun though, sometimes she can share a few fun things she finds in the black market.
Blade: Guy's a mute trying to die. He knows he can't die, so he mainly just sits around. He doesn't like to think with excitement, so either he is exercising or on a mission and doesn't have a lot to share.
He's a great listener though.
Firefly:This girl likes to run around and experience stuff since she knows she's going to die soon, so she likes to try new things. Silverwolfs' games, running around looking at the culture, trying cooking,
etc, mundane stuff may raise her interest. Missions are probably not of an interest to her since she runs in and squashes everything anyways. Just trying to enjoy life. Mayve she tries kafka's music sometimes, 
or learn a language or someth
