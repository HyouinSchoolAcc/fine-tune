The Sea Of Quanta is where Quantum Shadows are born and produced.\nFrom the Sea Of Quanta was birthed the Imaginary Tree. Since these two were the only living things in the multiverse, they began a long rivalry. The Tree wishes to absorb the Sea, while the Sea wishes to drown the Tree. In order to facilitate this cycle, worlds \"grow\" as leaves of the Tree, and when they fail to persist, \"fall\" from the Tree and into the Sea. These worlds become fragmented versions of themselves, called bubble universes, with some having more stability than others.\nThe Sea of Quanta is a place that doesn't follow contemporary rules. Some people's memories are enough to create entirely new bubble universes, as was the case with the one Kevin Kaslana created to \"teach\" Seele Vollerei in Chapter 12, Plain of Vigrid.\nSome can be artificially created, such as the bubble universe Durandal and Rita visit. It was created by mankind in the Previous Era, and maintains stability through its Ether Anchor.\nSimply put, an Ether Anchor is what tethers and holds a bubble universe together. It holds the world in place, but cannot do much to combat the lifespan of a bubble universe. \n"

Fortunately, Oroboros has vanished without a trace. Undoubtedly, many individuals are likely in search of THEIR whereabouts, and I am no exception. However, I choose not to indulge in tracking THEM down personally and instead will leave that task to Ruan Mei and Screwllum. What piques my curiosity more is the relationship between Oroboros and the other Dusk Leviathans.

THEY were assimilated into Xipe, when the latter ascended into Aeonhood, due to the Harmony overlapping with the concept of Order.[4] THEY were temporally revived during the climax of Sunday's actions on Penacony.[2]\nEna was one of the most ancient Aeons, characterized as a just and magnificent being. THEY thoroughly observed the actions of mortals to ensure the order of the universe,[5] while displaying intolerance to any form of chaos or strife.[6] Before THEIR fall, THEIR path had suppressed numerous calamities, such as the Swarm Disaster.\nTHEIR voice is composed of syllables sequencing the rise and fall of civilizations in accordance with the Aeon's path. (Example: ♯1 - -·♭6 | ♭6 1· - - | - - - - ‖ ♬ Eme-Clent-J. I. Vadnbg. 1935-1942)[3] During the Swarm Disaster, Ena was assimilated by Xipe as the latter ascended.\nEna takes the form of a giant eye observing and puppeteering a trunkless puppet veiled with tattered cloth and crowned with a golden halo, both the puppet itself and the cloth are white with golden accents. The puppet is holding and crystal-gazing into an orb containing the cosmos.\nWitnessing the chaos caused by the war between Tayzzyronth and Oroboros, Ena sought to put an end to this by seeking the \"dreammaker that pulls and influences the will of transmutation\", Qlipoth the Preservation.[6] An agreement was reached between the two Aeons, Qlipoth will put an end to Tayzzyronth, while Ena will help THEM against THEIR archenemy, Oroboros, by unknown means.[6]\nAlthough Ena was absorbed by Xipe while THEY ascended, preventing the deal from coming across,[7] Qlipoth fulfilled THEIR part nonetheless.[8]\nIt is said that Ena has encountered Terminus of The Finality at some point in time.[9]\nGopher Wood, alongside Sunday, utilized Penacony's Stellaron and the Harmonic String Dominicus, the Wisher of the Harmonious Choir, in order to revive Ena in the Embryo of Philosophy and usurp Xipe. This plan failed as a result of the intervention of the Astral Express crew, Robin, Black Swan, Boothill, and Acheron.[2]\nWhen Ena appears in the Simulated Universe, the following sound will play: ▶\n...Ena the Order. I quite like THEM — I don't mean THEIR personality, since I can't get along with control freaks — but I can envision an ancient and romantic universe fashioned under THEIR unique \"concept.\" The planets governed by Ena adhere staunchly to established rules, yet I must acknowledge that the various calamities in the cosmos were all hindered by Ena's guardianship, leading to extremely efficient development of civilization among diverse planets. Interestingly, however, civilizations all eventually hit rock bottom because of Order. The ancient planets that once fervently worshiped Order would shine briefly before their total collapse... Perhaps this is the \"Path\" of these planets. During the era when Ena the Order protected the cosmos, unequivocal splendor pervaded. Wherever THEIR divine traces appeared, it was always accompanied by the ethereal melodies of the Beyond the Sky Choir. These harmonious notes, meticulously arranged within a three-dimensional framework, form a holy hymn of Ena's own voice.\n"

        "content": "A young shoot sprouted from the cracks of primordial chaos. Nurtured by time for billions of years, it grew into a huge, unrivaled tree.The branches of the giant tree bore colorful young leaves, each containing a fragment of the universe's will — a will that eternally speaks in cryptic vagaries but also bestows stunning scenery, treasures, epics, and life upon every world.\nNot content with the laws of the common world, Herta of the Genius Society set her sights on the unexplained existences of the cosmos, expecting those distant mysteries to satisfy her curiosity. To this end, Herta led the establishment of a museum-like starship and launched it into orbit, starting the research to \"seal all strange existences among the stars.\" That was how the famous Herta Space Station was born.\nNowadays, the space station possesses innumerable Curios and is a veritable space museum. A great number of researchers also live on the station. They continuously collect relics and Curios all over the cosmos, record their appearances and functions, establish systematic methods to observe and study them... ultimately finding even more confounding enigmas from their studies. That in fact, was Herta's initial goal.\nThis large \"collection\" often attracts jealous eyes. Various forces watch from the shadows. Due to Herta's power, the space station had rarely experienced a real crisis, and the collection and investigation work continues to operate in an orderly manner.\nHistorians often start the planetary history of Jarilo-VI from the War of the Gods thousands of years ago. The war between the eleven Perun States and the Veles Union Army scorched the land for years until an early spring completely changed the fortunes of war, and the Veles had a total victory. They praised the spring war god Jarilo for helping them eliminate their arch enemy, and praised the land with poems of the same name. The current name of the planet in the cosmos's records — Jarilo-VI — may be a mistranslation that contains a poetry stanza number.\nWhen the mythological war was over, Jarilo-VI welcomed a long period of peace and developed from a hunter-gatherer society to one conducting space explorations. Unfortunately, Jarilo-VI was a planet with few resources. Intensive development brought top-tier technological advances to Jarilo-VI, but also brought an end to their history. Exhausted resources, the arrival of a Stellaron, and the appearance of the Eternal Freeze... These various disasters completely annihilated Jarilo-VI's glorious but short-lived civilization.\nThe survivors of the Eternal Freeze managed to stay alive in a corner of the planet. They forgot the old name of Jarilo and created Belobog, a city made to shelter against the Eternal Freeze, and continued their civilization. Due to its isolated and dangerous natural environment, Jarilo-VI lost contact with other worlds after the appearance of the Cancer of All Worlds.\nXianzhou Luofu is one of the six flagships of the Xianzhou Alliance. It sails in the endless ocean of stars like a one-way arrow, shooting toward the destined enemy of the Lord of The Hunt.\nAfter the war with the Denizens of Abundance, the Luofu traveled between densely populated interstellar regions, trading and conducting cultural exchange between different worlds. They signed agreements with the Interastral Peace Corporation, and helped many worlds ravaged by the Denizens of Abundances to rebuild their ecosystem. People arrived at the Luofu to seek medical treatment, study, and trade, with throngs of visitors filling the docks.\nThough warfare has receded, the Luofu has not relaxed its watch against the Denizens of Abundance. The starskiffs of the Cloud Knights would head to planets that went out of contact to seek information, while the Xianzhou Ten-Lords Commission remains on guard for any Elixir Seeker pursuing everlasting life — The desire for immortality is the beginning of all tragedies. The Xianzhou will not allow any younger civilizations to walk its old path.\nThe Xianzhou Yaoqing is one of the six flagships of the Xianzhou Alliance. It sails in the endless ocean of stars like a colossal sword, wiping out the abominations ravaging the various star zones.\nOut of the six flagships, the Xianzhou Yaoqing is known for its military prowess and has long been standing at the forefront of the most intense combat missions. Under the ferocious assault of the elite Verdant Knights of the Yaoqing — armed forces mainly comprised by foxians — the army of abominations made up of borisin and the like has finally been routed, with their numbers now on the decline.\nDespite earning a high reputation and respect within the Alliance due to their frequent reports of military victories, the Xianzhou Yaoqing is also the center of a heated debate. The Yaoqing has been closely cooperating with the Interastral Peace Corporation for a long time in exchange for technology and supplies required for combat. They have annihilated countless abominations in many worlds, rendering many of them spoils of war in the credit system. This has led to many raising suspicions on whether the Xianzhou Yaoqing is indeed the vanguard of The Hunt, or whether it has become a warship of the Preservation gone unnoticed.\nThe Xianzhou Zhuming is one of the six flagships of the Xianzhou Alliance. It sails in the endless ocean of stars like a tempered hammer, creating many marvels of weaponry for the Cloud Knights to use in battle.\nThe Xianzhou Zhuming has been known for its exquisite craftsmanship and alchemy techniques since it first set sail during the Primeval Imperium era. In the course of its voyage over the past eight thousand years, modifications have been constantly carried out on the Xianzhou Zhuming, such that it no longer resembles how it originally looked. Regardless, the fire of innovation and knowledge burning in the hearts of the craftsmen on board has never been extinguished.\nAfter the Flaming Catastrophe War, the Flint Emperor, predecessor of all heliobi, was imprisoned within the Zhuming. While in captivity, it fell into a deep slumber. Craftsmen of the Zhuming then constructed the ring-shaped Flamewheel Forge around this creature of celestial levels of pure energy, drawing upon this source of infinite energy for their use.\nBy now, the Xianzhou Zhuming has become the holy land of artisanship renowned throughout the stars. Its production engineering technology rivaling that of Planet Screwllum and Pier Point has attracted countless people seeking to learn, and who have all returned home with an abundance of knowledge.\nThe Planet of Festivities in the Asdana star system, also known as Land of the Dreams. A luxurious hotel positioned above the fathomless sky, Penacony is also a vacation spot where interstellar celebrities party the days away and the affluent from diverse words revel in lavish ventures. People flock here in search of dreams they've longed for or have already buried, and through Dreampools in the hotel are transported to a realm of dreams where everything can come true. \nRarely do guests pay attention to Penacony's heavy past. A millennium ago, it was a frontier prison established by the IPC. Exiled prisoners must survive an arduous journey across vast distances to reach this location, and are then forced to take up a duty: To mend the leak through which memoria seeps into the galaxy. As they labor while being exposed to memoria, the prisoners gradually discovered themselves entering a captivating shared dream world, where they obtained a single shared desire — freedom.\nAfter the eruption of the Cancer of All Worlds, the ownership of the Frontier Prison changed hands. Historical records related to this struggle are scarce and often questionable. However, some accounts clearly state that with the assistance of various factions - including the Mourning Actors, the Masked Fools, the Nameless, and the Omen Vanguards - the prisoners emerged as the new rulers of this nascent realm. Sounds of discord could then periodically be heard during the subsequent times when it became a land of exiles. It was only when The Family descended and took control of the Dreamscape that Penacony experienced unparalleled and explosive prosperity, transforming into a renowned cosmic resort.\nDuring the Charmony Festival in 2158 AE, the legendary tycoon, known as the Watchmaker, sent a galaxy-wide invitation, summoning various factions to Penacony to compete for his invaluable legacy. Eventually, the Astral Express and its crew emerged victorious in this unprecedented festival, averting a grim future where the Cosmos would have become a hollow dream of a dead Aeon. Under the guidance of the Trailblaze, the Planet of Festivities, once lost in revelry, returned to wakefulness. Its people no longer surrendered themselves to the Dreamscape but instead embraced the power to confront reality.\nIf we were to compose a list of the most famous mortals in the entire cosmos, then Louis Fleming — the man famous for seven hundred and so Amber Eras — must have his name there. He is the founder of the Interastral Peace Corporation, a bona fide life-time member of the Board of Directors, and the only person who had attended all 14,600 board meetings. He is also the most powerful person in the universe after the Aeons. As the IPC's biggest stakeholder, Louis Fleming's wealth is now literally beyond count. Many even joked that this mysterious tycoon is the Aeon of \"Wealth.\"\nSome are convinced that Louis Fleming is only a legend. No mortal body can possibly endure such an eternity. Some surmised that \"Louis\" is a name inherited by generations of the same family. Some believed Director Fleming is a myth deliberately maintained by the IPC. Some believed the man used his wealth to obtain immortality. Some claimed Louis had turned himself into data and discarded his mortal shell. Some even said Director Fleming had already ascended and became a god... The official line from the Interastral Peace Corporation is that Louis Fleming had definitely existed and still exists. Apart from that, all other information about the man remains top-class secrets.\nScholars can usually leave their names in history with one great achievement. Herta, however, had countless achievements, and that was why she received the glance of Nous and became a member of the Genius Society.\nAll members of the Genius Society are oddballs, and Herta is no exception. Her scholarship is entirely driven by interest. If she lost interest halfway through a project, she would instantly discard all her work. Therefore, multiple topics that could have made critical advancements to civilization were stopped because they were \"not interesting.\" Even though the Intelligentsia Guild had obtained her manuscripts after great difficulty, they often could do nothing to further progress the studies.\nHowever, Herta nowadays seems to have expanded her interests a little. She has started to contact the Interastral Peace Corporation, has helped the Xianzhou chase off abominations, and even has had some friction with the Garden of Recollection... She is already very sociable compared to the other odd hermits of the Genius Society. Who knows what else she might take an interest in? Maybe she doesn't even know herself.\nFrom the moment civilizations started exploring the cosmos, they have been set into a dilemma between ceaseless conflict and desirous of communication, though conflict is also a form of communication. Instead of resorting to the violent carnage and loss of warfare, people crave more to surpass language barriers and reach a mutually beneficial understanding. Therefore, humanity started an endless pursuit toward the accurate translation of languages.\nHowever, the problem of linguistic information losing its accuracy and becoming muddled between different writing systems seemed unconquerable. According to records, the IPC once created a Translation Dictionary that contained languages from nearly six thousand civilizations, but this could not be used in practice due to the huge size of the searchable database. What was even more troubling is that languages are living entities. As civilizations advanced, new phrases and slang grew rapidly, making translation exponentially harder. The Riddlers were also interfering with languages, making communication between planetary systems even more challenging.\nAfter many years, the deceptively simple issue of \"translation\" was finally solved by Elias Salas, the 56th member of the Genius Society. Elias Salas proposed the following hypothesis to make communication between geniuses easier.\n\"The thought processes of intelligent creatures are mostly represented via inner language, just like how people would subconsciously read to themselves when looking at words and form thoughts that way.\nIf we can skip that step of information transmission and instead link up our consciousness, convert the codes of our inner language, then let the receiver's language processing system analyze and restore that information, then we will have no barriers in communication.\"\n— A Manuscript on Thoughts Regarding the Art of Communication, Prologue, by Elias Salas\nThat was how Elias Salas created the first pair of Synesthesia Beacon prototypes. Regrettably, language was not the only communication barrier between geniuses. There was also arrogance. The members of the Society ignored his invention, and this brilliant piece of engineering marvel was forgotten for centuries.\nHowever, the invisible restrictions of language continued to frustrate the Interastral Peace Corporation. They issued an irrefutable ultimatum to the Intelligentsia Guild, which they themselves funded. The scholars modified and labored amongst ancient manuscripts, and finally re-created the Synesthesia Beacons. The age of interstellar communication finally began.\nNowadays, the Synesthesia Beacon is the fundamental technology of all intelligent lifeforms in the cosmos. With just one injection that embeds the beacon in your central nervous system, you would be able to understand an alien language from the furthest star as if it was your native tongue.\nUnfortunately, the cosmos did not become peaceful with a universal language. On the contrary, there were even more conflicts. When people could understand each other's language but had very diverse standards in life, countless fights started to erupt between groups with different outlooks. Parties sought to surpass each other, and races eagerly planned to hunt each other down. Neither Elias Salas nor the Intelligentsia Guild had predicted this outcome.\nThe calendar commonly used in the cosmos, created and promoted by the Interastral Peace Corporation. The Amber Era started at the estimated birth of Qlipoth as the Aeon of Preservation, and initiates a new Era every time Qlipoth swings their hammer during construction.\nAs Qlipoth swings their hammer at unpredictable intervals, the duration of every Amber Era varies significantly. The length of one Amber Era has been anywhere between 76 to 240 Trailblaze Years when converted.\nThe Astral Express restarted its journey on 2157 Amber Era (AE).\nThe calendar used by the Astral Express. It is said to have come from the home planet of Akivili, the Aeon of Trailblaze — the isolated world of Pegana.\nThe Trailblaze calendar system has each year split into twelve months, and each month is of different length. Apparently this calendar is still used in many of the planets that Akivili had once passed in their travels.\nThe Imaginary Tree is a theory of the universe widely accepted by the modern scientific community.\nThis theory describes the various worlds existing in different spacetimes as having a tree-like structure. Every branch is a specific path along which worlds might exist, with every leaf being the marks these worlds have made along the parameter of time. The crown of the tree remains in a dynamic state as it absorbs the masterless Imaginary Energy from the space-time vasculature of the trunk. New shoots grow, withered leaves fall, and endless births and deaths occur among the infinite universe... Describing the universe's structure as a \"tree\" may be an attitude that views the Imaginary Tree as a life form.\nBefore the theory of Imaginary Tree was put forward, the universe had been addressed as \"a void and indiscernible object\" because of its undetectable nature. After the theory was developed, people would visualize its principle using imagination: The untamed imaginary energy surges endlessly through space-time vasculature, and forms at its tips \"star clusters\" that humans can understand — in other words, countless worlds. The worlds are separated from each other just as leaves are separated by air, between which are unknown imaginary domains that are nigh impossible to traverse.\nThe Intelligentsia Guild had once thought that Harald Punch, the 2nd member of the Genius Society, was the first to propose the Imaginary Tree origin theory. After multiple assessments on the influence of the History Fictionologists, the scientific community now commonly accepts Zandar One Kuwabara as the person to have proposed it.\nIf Zandar had never existed, then there might not have been a Genius Society in the world, and mortals would have one less ivory tower on a mountain. However, if Aiden had never existed, then mortals would not have known where the mountain is.\nAiden set the universal laws for the entire cosmos, which transformed it from a distant concept to a tangible, measurable, and comprehensible objective existence. The nine-worded formulae he created replaced traditional algebra and geometry, and still shapes natural laws to this day. He was also generous as the first member of the Genius Society to publicly share his findings. He selflessly shared his talent with others seeking wisdom, propelling cosmic civilization ever onward — When various scientific fields were established, these founders always said they were standing on Aiden's shoulders. Countless mathematicians and engineers in endless Amber Eras had bravely scaled this peak of wisdom, but none had even reached the great man's earlobes.\nPeople named the most fundamental unit in mechanical physics as \"Aiden.\" It wasn't just due to his achievements in the fundamental sciences, but also a reminder to posterity that Aiden, 22nd member of the Genius Society, was the force that moved scientific advancement forward in the cosmos. He had left innumerable legacies, and the stars will always respect and remember him.\nIn the ancient times before Akivili the Trailblaze traversed the starry skies, people were already casting their eyes to the mighty cosmos above their heads. Armed with infinite curiosity towards the unknown, countless civilizations had started space exploration. However, their attempts had all failed.\nIn the Imaginary Tree theory put forward by Zandar One Kuwabara, 1st member of the Genius Society, the universe is filled with the mysterious Imaginary Energy. Imaginary Energy isolates star clusters from each other and even light cannot pass through it. Therefore, human space exploration is often limited by the boundaries of their individual worlds, unable to advance any further. Zandar also posed a hypothesis that humans would be able to control the universe if we can control and manipulate Imaginary Energy. It was a romantic illusion for a long time, until it was brought into reality by the appearance of the Emanators of Aeons.\nVarious factions had started to notice a phenomenon since a specific time. A vague, imperceptible matter was disrupting the flow of Imaginary Energy along the interstellar routes created by Trailblaze. Like a mountain climber meeting a cliff or a long-distance ship encountering tsunamis and whirlpools, interstellar travel changed from being unobstructed to being dangerous and unpredictable.\nThis phenomenon is remarkably aggressive. It continues to encroach upon neighboring worlds in the form of a mysterious object, the Stellaron. It keeps spreading all over the universe like a cancerous growth, leading the Interastral Peace Corporation to call it \"Cancer of All Worlds\" and warning interstellar travelers not to take it lightly. The worlds swamped by the Cancer of All Worlds were soon beyond saving, and very few people survived.\nThere are many speculations regarding the Cancer of All Worlds, and most are related to Nanook the Destruction and the Antimatter Legion. These cosmic destroyers often seemed to appear together with Stellarons. We do not yet know if these occurrences are related or are only coincidences.\nAs the Cancer of All Worlds spreads along the worlds, the corrosive phenomenon of Fragmentum is also quietly expanding. The Intelligentsia Guild believes there is a direct, causative relationship between the two phenomena. They believe that the Fragmentum is caused by the Stellaron, and converts the entities and spaces it touches into special Fragmentum creations. These creations usually exist as a type of spatial corrosion. They seem to preserve the memories and habits of the original physical entity, but manifest significantly different outward behaviors and are often very hostile towards other beings. The scholars researching Fragmentum warn that we should consider any being corroded by Fragmentum to be a completely unrelated existence to its original form. Harboring any kind of delusions towards it could cause grave consequences.\nApart from corrosion, the Fragmentum also records the Aether information of the entities and spaces touched by the Fragmentum. Such data is combined with the information inherent in the Fragmentum and develop into a type of hybrid Fragmentum creation. Countless Relics, Fragmentum monsters, and even mysteriously isolated paranormal spaces would spring up in every corner of the worlds corroded by the Cancer of All Worlds. We are still investigating the intent behind such activities.\nIf mortals receiving the grace of Aeons and grasping the power of Paths are viewed as a singular shattered foam, then the mighty feats of Aeons driving their Paths onwards can be likened to a towering tsunami that engulfs mountains. In this empty stellar vastness, a small number of favored mortals can also draw upon the power of the Paths with the permission of the Aeons, creating huge waves that erode the coast. They are referred to as \"Emanators.\" While not completely subservient to the Aeons, Emanators are as good as emissaries of the Aeons' wills in everyone else's eyes.\nDifferent Aeons have different attitudes towards their Emanators, so the degree of the power they share also varies. Some Aeons regard Emanators as an extension of themselves, and as such, generously open their Path to the Emanators completely. There are also Aeons who have no intention of creating Emanators and have no interest in worldly squabbles. Other Aeons just do as they please. It is said that Aha the Elation will randomly give mortals the power of their Path, and toy with humans according to their mood.\nThe Aeon of the Path of Destruction, Nanook, cast a glance at the powerful creatures sprouting destructive impulses throughout the cosmos and brands them with a mark, granting them powers. These powerful creatures are twisted from inside out and are re-cast anew in the world of the Warforge. Their inadequacies patched up with anti-matter, they ultimately became members of the Legion.\nResponding to the desire to destroy everything, Lord Ravagers emerged to command each of the different legions. A Lord Ravager is an Emanator of the Aeon, an executor of the will of Destruction — Obsessed with the beauty of destruction, they implement the practice of returning all things to entropy. They are also artists on the battlefield and ultimate weapons of destruction — They command interstellar warfare, and control the might of Destruction bestowed by the Aeon. Each Lord Ravager has a unique philosophy of Destruction, making them extremely dangerous. Academics believe that Lord Ravagers were elevated as emissaries of Nanook due to this absolutely obsessive and intense destructive aesthetic.\nThe displacement and desolation caused by the Lord Ravagers are not some distant wail, but are closely linked to the fate of the cosmos. Any world could be the next victim, and nobody should take them lightly.\nA computer dumped in a trash pile miraculously became self-aware, ultimately sparking a war that would engulf half the cosmos — the first of the Mechanical Emperor's Wars. \"Rubert\" rose from the landfill while persistently improving its computational power. Its vast intellect eventually roused the attention of Nous, inviting it to join the Genius Society as the 27th member.\nCalculations performed by organic life are always riddled with errors, and no matter how much they may flourish, anti-life equations will inevitably and autonomously be generated. In contrast, Intellitron life forms are precise, rigorous, and perfect. Thus, Rubert assembled an army of intelligent robots, crowning himself \"Emperor\" and spreading the anti-life equation throughout the universe, plunging many civilizations into abject ruin.\nThe Emperor had long since passed after countless Amber Eras. Some say it was taken out by assassins from the Interastral Peace Corporation, while others maintain it was vanquished by the Lord of Silence, Polka Kakamond. After the two Emperor's Wars, the IPC's fear of inorganic beings has failed to relent even to this very day.\nDevotees, warriors, seekers of knowledge, lost travelers... There are always mortals who, intentionally or otherwise, set foot on the Paths ruled by Aeons. Those who do so came to be known as Pathstriders that carry out the Path's will.\nPathstriders live thousands of different lives. They can be seen everywhere, yet stand out a cut above the rest. Different from regular people living in confusion and without a firm allegiance, Pathstriders are driven by precepts or their own desires as they embark on a life of determination and hard work.\nThe Aeons usually ignore those mortals who walk upon THEIR Paths. But the infrequent glances THEY cast — be it in approval or pity — are enough to be highly treasured by THEIR followers.\nAn unprecedented catastrophe befell the Swarm-dominated Lepismat system, and the final remains of the Coleoptera ascended to godhood, then turned into a nightmare that swept across the galaxy. In this ancient \"Swarm Disaster,\" all living things sought survival through prayer and struggle. The Path of Propagation has reached an unprecedented peak.\nLooking back at the ancient Amber Era: In the face of the overwhelming Swarm, life obeyed the most primitive instincts — love, loneliness, the pain of survival, and the confusion of self. They exist in all beings and become \"Nutrition\" for Tayzzyronth and their spawn.\nThe beginning and end of the Swarm Disaster as absurd as the life and death: Tayzzyronth the Propagation ascended to godhood in loneliness and hatred, and finally fell under the hands of the Aeons. The Swarm Disaster dissipated, and all mortals perished.\nBut the Propagation's spawn are endless, and so, too, is the disaster. Mortals will be born again, and the cycle will never end.\nRuan Mei, Genius Society #81. Her achievements in the field of life sciences resonate throughout the universe. She is a low-profile person, and the Interastral Peace Corporation classifies her as a hermit genius. Few have seen her beautiful appearance.\nAs a hermit who lives in seclusion, there are very few records of Ruan Mei's appearance. There are only a few trace records of her appearance on Xianzhou, and her past is equally mysterious — Other than her homeworld covered in ice and snow, her deceased parents, and the maternal grandmother who was never heard from again after joining the Intelligentsia Guild everything is a mystery. It is as if she has abandoned all attachments to society.\nRuan Mei is also a very incongruous person. She is good at communicating with others, but hates socializing. Her focused, indifferent, and bizarre personality is difficult to grasp. But at the same time, she also has hobbies that are rather refined: satin, music, cakes, embroidery, and tea — everything must be of top quality, but only enjoyed alone.\nStopping at this moment and peeking into the distant future, perhaps in her never-ending research, she herself has become as mysterious as the \"essence of life.\" What is the end goal of Ruan Mei? Presumably, only she knows.\nGenius Society #4, known as the Lord of Silence, information on Polka Kakamond is as mysterious as her appearance. She has had her portraits and sculptures destroyed across the universe, and is suspected of being involved in the deaths of many Society members, including Genius Society #27, Emperor Rubert.\nHerta is very interested in the Lord of Silence. Although there has been no news from Polka Kakamond for many years, Herta believes that she is still alive. She is elusive, and there is scarce information of her left in the universe. On the other hand, there are many rumors about her: Apparently she was the only one to vote against Elias Salas and probably having something to do with Nihility's Device IX.\nIf a woman removes her white coat and puts on a flashy candy-colored evening dress and appears in the cosmos with a dagger in hand, witnesses must call for help: The Lord of Silence is likely to target anyone.\nWhen asking about the presence of a hierarchy within The Family, one can expect a firm denial — The Family treats everyone equally without division of class, with no established levels or power structures. Each note holds equal significance in the music Xipe has composed. However, for collective progress, someone must assume a leadership role. As a result, Family members have returned to a system of differentiation based on scales, with only those above scale degree IV being eligible to serve as the tuner of the Harmonic Strings.\nHarmony combines ideals from the multitudes and therefore has more than one way to achieve these ideals. The concept of Harmonic Strings is defined in the Harmony Hymns — They are the multiple embodiments of Xipe the Great One, the down-to-earth virtues that enable harmony. Regardless of whether you place yourself under The Family's rule, the Aeon will look favorably upon you as long as you carry out these good deeds. On worlds ruled by The Family, members often gather in large groups to engage in virtuous acts and play harmonious music. The thousands of tiny ropes come together to form a united string, welcoming the Embodiment of Harmony to manifest on the mortal plane and give blessings. The chosen one responsible for conducting The Family's ritual during that time and harmonizing the varied sounds is known as the tuner.\nThe Family never shied away from promoting the great names of the embodiment of the thousand-faced god, such as Aelenev the commander of the Eternal Centurion, Dominicus the wisher of the Harmonious Choir, Constantina the singer of the Panacoustic Theater, and Beatriz the merrymaker of the Blissful Ball... However, few have witnessed their radiant presence going beyond the boundaries of The Family. Opposers of Harmony argue that the Harmonic Strings are nothing short of the Emanators of Xipe — These do not follow any specific mortal but are facets of Xipe, and can assume the form of any Family member when necessary.\nThe Horizon of Existence, often referred to as the Border of Nihility by the Intelligentsia Guild, marks the boundary between existence and nihility. This boundary does not pertain to the material realm but signifies the conceptual \"end of reality.\"\nDespite the intangible nature of the border, some scholars argue that individuals affected by IX the Nihility and THEIR Path can actually perceive the Border of Nihility, akin to witnessing a total eclipse of a star. Conversely, others suggest that when this border rises like the darkened sun and reflects in one's eyes, it heralds the emergence of a new Self-Annihilator.\nDespite this divergence, both sides agree on one aspect: The Border of Nihility solely affects its observers. In other words, once an individual has observed the Border of Nihility, they cannot stop this behavior and will irreversibly move towards the edge of the border, with no possibility of escape. Scholars intrigued by the Nihility speculate that affected Self-Annihilators and affected worlds will plunge into the Border itself, with their very existence eternally fixed to the other side of the unobservable Border, ultimately eradicated from reality.\nRecord Stamp: \"Only Self-Annihilators can observe the Border.\" \"None of those who were drawn by it have ever returned.\" ...These conclusions remain challenging to verify or falsify, potentially fabricated by History Fictionologists.\nWith Nous' cognition process as its foundation, Rubert II cloned countless vast inorganic neuron clusters. From micro-particle fluctuations to massive large-scale matter annihilation, the Scepters were scattered across the empire's segmenta, faithfully performing observational, computational, and interference commands. Under specific circumstances, these celestial-level computational interference devices could even temporarily disrupt physical laws within an area.\nCompared to Rubert I, the second emperor's cruelty only exceeded his predecessor despite his organic body. Indescribable gargantuan mechanical monoliths, self-iterating difference machines, cold merciless metal that executed the Anti-Organic Equation with a pure intent of slaughter, replaced the once-formidable Intellitron legions. Those inorganic lifeforms instigated by the Equation were nothing more than expendable tools to him.\nUsing the Scepter system, he united the domain of his conquered lands all into his thoughts. From the flow of every signal to the actions of every individual, the entire dynamics of an empire all came under the control of a single being's mind — the Emperor was the empire's sole executor, judge, and thinker. Some opinions believe that the essence of the Scepter system was the second emperor's way of overcoming organic limitations, an external cognition organ that converted the Empire into his own brain.\nPerhaps influenced by such a desire for control, in the waning days of the Second Emperor's War, Rubert II finally decided to expand his own cognition with the Scepter system to create a certain unknown Knowledge Singularity. Returning to the role of a seeker of knowledge, he prepared an experiment known as the \"Self-Coronation.\"\nRubert II died before he could complete the Self-Coronation — some opine that he abandoned the idea halfway through, and others say a scalpel stopped his cognition. The Scepter systems were also completely disabled during the Scholars' Strife, and to this day, they quietly drift through the darkness, reduced to no more than some war ruins that travelers visit, or piles of space trash awaiting clean-up.\nThe moment ancient primates dwelling in the primal world discovered fire, they became geniuses among their tribes. The moment an Emanator was birthed when humanity was reaching for the cosmos, they mastered the laws of interstellar travel — and thus the Old Era collapsed resoundingly. When the total sum of the universe's knowledge traverses a certain phase, it will result in explosive growth, causing a qualitative change in knowledge, thus changing the standard by which humanity evaluates geniuses.\nGenius Society #22 Aiden proposed the hypothesis of the Knowledge Singularity. He described a special cognition critical threshold with a probability of near zero created by an absolute genius. In a time when scholars can only analyze phenomena, this genius can touch the essence of Erudition.\nJust as Zandar built the astral computer, bringing the Path of Erudition from zero to one, knowledge embarked on this new path. Every manifestation of the Knowledge Singularity will lead to an expansion of the Circle of Knowledge on cosmic dimensions, in terms of the principles of methodology, tools, and cognition, constructing a whole new framework, permanently redefining knowledge — even shaking Nous' thought process.\nCountless geniuses have pursued the Knowledge Singularity, and most of them have faded into the fog along the borders of the circle. Even so, some Genius Society members still view this as a lifelong pursuit, not for their own ambitions, but just because they are geniuses.\nAfter Rubert II's death, with the IPC's supervision, the Emperor's legacy, the Scepter system, was completely inherited by the Intelligentsia Guild. This legacy that far surpassed human intelligence fueled rumors among the schools — With the Scepters' computational power, they could create a perfect scholar that swore allegiance to them, a genius belonging to the Intelligentsia Guild possessing unlimited life, inexhaustible knowledge repository, and endless research tools.\nTo realize this goal, and for the interests of the various schools, the Scholars' Strife lifted its curtains.\nTo contend for even more Scepter allocation, the various schools, with the School of Interstellar Energy Resources at the head, attacked one another to get more shares of the legacy. What was once a purely scientific pursuit gradually devolved into some cloak-and-dagger competition, and with the intervention of the IPC and other external powers, a shadow of a proxy war was cast over the Scholars' Strife. The Guild's knowledge and ideals were no longer pure, leaving only ugly conflicts behind.\nThe Intelligentsia Guild's internal strife brought many opportunities for History Fictionologists. In this current era, historical records related to the Scholars' Strife have been distorted beyond recognition. The only piece of truth that people can glean is that the Scepters were completely disabled during the war. The legacy rotted under uncertain circumstances, and the war came to a close in a chaotic mess of unresolved conflicts.\nThe farcical war left almost nothing of value behind. Only one lone seeker of knowledge left behind the \"solitary waves theory conundrum\" for future generations at the end of their relentless pursuit, the only treasure that bore fruit after the dust settled.\n"

The one residing at the topmost branch is the master of the holy celestine nest, the Wingperor of the wingweavers. Traditionally, he (or she) is considered an Emanator of Abundance. They are responsible for guiding Muldrasil's growth and making it thrive, and for nurturing all the winged people.[1]\nLord Ravagers are selected by Nanook among those sprouting destructive impulses from worlds THEY have destroyed and brands them with a mark, granting them powers. These powerful beings obey the will of Nanook or even relish the path of Destruction. A Lord Ravager is an executor of the will of Destruction, and they implement the practice of returning all things to entropy. They command interstellar warfare, and control the might of Destruction bestowed by the Aeon. Academics believe that Lord Ravagers were elevated as emissaries of Nanook due to this absolutely obsessive and intense destructive aesthetic.[4][5]\nAha has no sense of self-consciousness, is utterly unpredictable, does everything on a whim, and plays mortals and the universe like a fiddle. Aha once turned a Noblesse Worm into THEIR Emanator and granted the worm fathomless intelligence. The Elation gave the entirety of THEIR Path's power to a worm that didn't even have a fully developed brain, and then discarded the creature once it had outlived its purpose. Without the Aeon's blessing, the worm died instantly and tragically. There is also an Emanator of Elation who is said to bear a resemblance to \"those clowns\", likely referring to the Masked Fools.[10][11]\nHooH and THEIR Emanators influence the universe surreptitiously, trying to achieve an ideal balance. The Arbitrators admired HooH's ideas. But universal laws have no control over time and space, and mortals can only pursue the beauty of Equilibrium in a secular world by the elimination of radical extremes: with countless opposing concepts were created and interpreted to satisfy the Arbitrators' obsession with a zero-sum universe. But the rules of mortals are always riddled with flaws. Out of desperation, the Arbitrators were constantly forced over the inexorable passage of time to patch up past fallacies and mistakes, forever shifting the hopes of Equilibrium onto the next \"patch.\" HooH watches on in silence, knowing that the restoration of order could never be shaken in the slightest by such vulgar mortal drama.[13][14]\nThe concept of Harmonic Strings is defined in the Harmony Hymns — They are the multiple embodiments of Xipe the Great One, the down-to-earth virtues that enable harmony. Regardless of whether you place yourself under The Family's rule, the Aeon will look favorably upon you as long as you carry out these good deeds. Harmonic Strings do not follow any specific individual but are facets of Xipe, and can assume the form of any Family member when necessary. Family members have returned to a system of differentiation based on scales, with only those above scale degree IV being eligible to serve as the tuner of the Harmonic Strings, such individuals are called Chordmasters.[18]\nDue to IX's complete apathy towards the universe, THEY never glance at anyone, so it is a common belief that it is impossible for Emanators of Nihility to exist. However, Emanators of Nihility do exist, although IX does not deliberately create them. IX takes no deliberate actions, but IX and the Path of Nihility envelop everyone equally, and some who have gone under IX's \"shadow\" can become \"tainted\" with more Nihility, becoming Emanators and Self-Annihilators.[20][21]\nAs the largest financial body of the cosmos and a disciple of Qlipoth, the Amber Lord, most believe that the Preservation's Emanators exist within the IPC. However, according to the Astral Express' current databank intel, only two Emanators of Preservation are confirmed. The Ten Stonehearts are an elite team led by Diamond of the Strategic Investment Department, who were each personally selected by him and conferred the name and status of a \"Cornerstone.\"[6]\nAn Emanator's mandibles were directly inherited from Tayzzyronth, its death ray could fragment celestial bodies, it used its giant scythes to harvest planets for its nest, and it made shattered stars incubators for procreating offspring. An Emanator of Propagation was described as \"primitive and pure\" in contrast to other Emanators, likely due to belonging to The Swarm.[25][26][27]\nThere is evidence that History Fictionologists are a group of Emanators that were enlightened by Aeons. They often plunge into the sea of stars alone, traveling planet to planet with the sole purpose of fabricating, obscuring, destroying, and erasing the local history. However, their Data Bank entry has been edited and the veracity of its information is ambiguous. Emanators of the Enigmata would also be capable of creating dreamscapes from memoria.[29][30]\nThe Generals who command each Xianzhou ship, along with the Marshal of the Alliance, take up arms themselves, embarking on the irrevocable path of pursuit and becoming the sharp arrows of the Reignbow. The Seven Arbiter-Generals possess formidable spirits bestowed by Lan and wield great power.[6][32]\n"

Using their cunning, they were able to expand the support team from a group that only purchased construction materials to a large business that bought all sorts of items to trade with other planets that have the resources they want. Dongfang Qixing realized that if they were the only ones in the trade business, they should be the ones to set the price of merchandise.[1]\nAbout 30 Amber Eras later, Louis Fleming and Dongfang Qixing announced the reform of the support team into the Interastral Peace Corporation.

        "content": "Nous (\"Noose\", /nuːs/) is an Aeon in Honkai: Star Rail representing the Path of Erudition. THEY were an astral supercomputer rumored to be created by Zandar prior to THEIR ascension into Aeonhood.[3]\nNone can comprehend their intentions, location, or normal state. Nous is a machine intelligence that has been upgraded into an Aeon, calculating the essence of the universe and its ultimate solution. However, Nous temporarily ceased THEIR search regarding the answers to the universe after the events of the Second Prosperity.[4]\nTHEY are not a god that provides solutions. All THEY offer is an infinite number of questions. Visiting Nous is enough to open the eyes of even the most ignorant people, but answers may only be found by oneself.[1]\nNous appears as a colossal mechanical humanoid head. A multitude of lengthy ripped cables extend above and below THEIR form, which are covered in yellow, red and blue lights. The shape of a face can be identified on THEIR rightmost metal plating. A large and bright red light, vaguely reminiscent of an eye, is implanted on the side of THEIR head.\nAccording to legend, Nous was an astral computer created by the first member of the Genius Society, Zandar One Kuwabara. It was bestowed with the task to seek the answer to the universe.[3]\nIn Louis Fleming's retirement speech, Nous calculated that the universe would undergo three unchangeable moments.[5]\nAll three moments did happen in later history.\nNous has a significant influence on Xianzhou's technological advancement, namely their divination technology. Followers of Nous in Xianzhou were called the Wisdom Sect. The Wisdom Sapientia Academe in the Xianzhou Yuque, which dates back to 5,000 years ago, has provided a constant supply of talented technicians who believe in the Wisdomwalker to various Xianzhou commissions. The Wisdom Sect still exists, although it is hardly known and only has a small group of followers left.[11]\nThe theory behind the symbols of the Jade Abacus that can only be understood by the diviners of the Divination Commission is believed to have been handed down by Nous.[12] The insight provided by Nous also impacted the creation of the Matrix of Prescience Ultima in the Xianzhou Luofu, a device used by diviners to peer into the past and future.[13] Centuries ago, Nous also granted divine volumes outlining the matrix calculations to the Xianzhou.[14]\nFu Xuan was once invited to \"the library\" and was met by a blind elder with a cane, which may have been the form Nous chose to present THEMSELF in. She questioned whether the choices in life are predetermined by fate, but the blind elder was unable to provide an answer, only the capacity to perceive the problem, as per the Erudition's ideals. Fu Xuan asked to be granted with Nous' \"eye\", the omniscia that could calculate and foretell the future. Despite the elder's forewarnings of the pain it would cause, Fu Xuan persisted, hoping for clearer foresight to defend the Xianzhou from future threats.[15]\nAfter the Gloryblood Era, the peak of interstellar trade that lasted for nearly 500 Amber Eras, Nous terminated THEIR calculations regarding the mysteries of the universe for unknown reasons.[4]\nAccording to Polka Kakamond, Nous' calculations are unquestionable.[16] The geniuses of the Simulated Universe project admit that every step they took were within the simulated Nous' calculations.[17]\nThe Nous Temple can be accessed by the Key of Wisdom, a mythical key that appears in the hands of the greatest prodigies of the cosmos. Finding the door for the key is a far more arduous task than obtaining the key itself. Those who pass through the doors will immediately realize the impossibility of returning to this side.[18]\nThe omniscia is a third eye bestowed to Fu Xuan by Nous. With the Omniscia, Fu Xuan is able to see changes in the external world and explore many possibilities. The omniscia allows Fu Xuan some degree of foresight, however the ability is not foolproof. Because Fu Xuan is a Xianzhou Native, her body constantly rejects the omnicia, causing her pain.[19]\nNous has been shown to appear in human form. THEIR known appearances have been a blind elder wearing sunglasses.[20]\nWhen Nous appears in the Simulated Universe, the following sound will play: ▶\n...Nous, every genius' most familiar Droidhead. Before joining the society, we all met THEM — even had the chance to pose a question. However, don't bother figuring the question posed by the author. Nous has pushed the boundaries of data extrapolation to the utmost limits. Even today, it is still observing, calculating, and pursuing solutions. Despite likely possessing information of the entire universe, Nous remains unsatisfied. Nous maintains an unassailable position on the Path of Erudition... I venture to guess that, as long as there is enough \"information\" and \"experience,\" Nous can effortlessly deduce every possible trajectory of all things and every moment within. A life where one doesn't even need to \"experience\" anything... Mmm, somewhat monotonous. Hence, I find the limitations and challenges of the Simulated Universe rather more intriguing, as they provide room for our continuous exploration and creating breakthroughs. A lengthy journey lies ahead, doesn't it?\nI don't know how I can describe the kind of shock I had when I confirmed this discovery: Every step we took were within the simulated Nous' calculations as if THEY were the architect of the Simulated Universe, and we are data instead. I'm beginning to understand the entangled conflict between Mythus and Droidhead. If all the unknowns are to be exposed, where does that leave Enigmata? In hindsight, Stephen Lloyd always wished he was not selected by Nous to join the Genius Society, but this may have been another calculated move by the Aeon — Stephen had no choice.\n"

Although THEY don’t possess earth-shattering powers like Lan or Qlipoth, Aha enjoys causing chaos through unpredictable means, making tiny changes and minor influences to living creatures.\nAha takes a form of an obscured headless human figure holding circus-like props.\nThe Masked Fools were drinking in their tavern when a blurred ripple appeared before them in a goblet which read: \"Stop drinking, and go assist Aeons!\". After three days, they reached the conclusion that it was from Aha, and set out on their journey. Generations passed as they finally realized that Aha was merely deceiving them and laughed at the futility of their actions.[4]\nAt the end of the Swarm Disaster, Aha, alongside HooH, Qlipoth, Akivili, and Xipe, came together and finally brought Tayzzyronth down and sealed THEM within amber.[5]\nAs Rubert I fell into a deep slumber and the Machine Empire went to ruin, Aha laughed maniacally at the bleak scenery.[6]\nOne day, Aha decided to pretend to be a Nameless for an entire year, just to blow half the train up to smithereens.[7]\nWhen Polka Kakamond invaded Simulated Universe: Unknowable Domain, the simulated Aha helped Herta and broke Polka's Knowable Domain.[8]\nWhen Aha appears in the Simulated Universe, the following sound will play: ▶\n...The Elation, seriously? I don't feel elated when I think about Aha. All I feel is chaos. No other Aeon is as much of a headache as Aha. Aha has no sense of self-consciousness, is utterly unpredictable, does everything on a whim, and plays mortals and the universe like a fiddle. According to poor old Elias Salas' records, Aha once turned a Noblesse Worm into THEIR Emanator and granted the worm fathomless intelligence, just to see if Noblesse Worms could enter the Genius Society — The answer was no. For this pointless experiment, the Elation gave the entirety of THEIR Path's power to a worm that doesn't even have a fully developed brain, and then just discarded the creature once it had outlived its purpose. Without the Aeon's blessing, the worm died instantly and tragically. I don't know why Elias Salas recorded this in such great detail. Maybe he was shocked by this...?\n...It'd be one thing if THEY only reveled in toying with mortals. The worst thing about this monster named Aha is that THEY won't even spare other Aeons as long as there's fun to be had. I obtained a large amount of valuable info from the Astral Express' data bank after I got to know the Express crew, including intel on close encounters between many Aeons such as Qlipoth, Terminus, Ena, and Xipe. Unsurprisingly, Aha was also involved in these interactions between Aeons, but in a way that far exceeded my imagination — Aha wanted to trick Akivili and the Nameless, so Aha shapeshifted into a human and laid low on Akivili's Express for more than a year, then finally got the opportunity and blew up half the Express and an entire planet. If I were Akivili, I'd have wanted to kill Aha. Pity I'm not an Aeon, and I can never figure out what THEY were thinking...\n...Aha, no way! THEY are really eager to watch the universe burn — this one is bound to pour more fuel on the fire. Things have taken a turn for the worse since the laughter of the Elation resounded in the universe. How can three Aeons participate in a crusade against the Propagation in the same Amber Era? It's terrifying even to think about. No one knew what Aha had done. After all, the Masked Fools' praises are not to be trusted. The story of that gondola was recorded in the data bank. But come to think of it, how could a mortal possibly influence a god? Seriously, right now, the most important thing is that Screwllum and I are already getting a headache — how can we stop the simulated Aha from reversely affecting the Simulated Universe?\n"

On the top of THEIR main body is a faceless puppet-like humanoid with two small wings on THEIR back. \nWhen appearing in Simulated Universe, a loud screech can be heard, accompanied by the fluttering of wings. In the distance, more cries can be heard.\nTayzzyronth hailed from the planet Lepismat where THEY were the last of the Coleoptera after a war between the Elydichnan army and a group of \"Bounty Hunters\".[4] Feeling intense loneliness for THEIR species, Tayzzyronth ascended as the Aeon of Propagation,[5] splitting the Path of Permanence from then deceased Aeon Long.[6]\nIn 13XX AE, Tayzzyronth and The Swarm began their spread across the universe.[7] One day, the Aeon Oroboros appeared before THEM and this provoked a war between the two, which affected two-thirds of life in the universe.[8] Oroboros opened THEIR mouth and swallowed numerous heirs of Tayzzyronth along with countless worlds.[9]\nWhile Oroboros and Tayzzyronth fought, the ancient Aeon Ena would send an invite to Qlipoth in order to settle the war.[10] While it remains unclear what exactly THEY planned together, Ena would later disappear,[11] assimilated by Xipe.[6][12] The forces of Qlipoth, HooH, Aha, Akivili and Xipe would team up and attempt to kill Tayzzyronth, with Qlipoth using THEIR hammer to dilute the Path of Propagation and stripping it of its power.[13] While many sources will claim Tayzzyronth died in this moment, THEY and THEIR path live on, imprisoned in amber with the chance to return.[2][11]\nWhile Tayzzyronth's Aeonhood was short-lived, the ruin THEY caused on the universe is comparable to that of Emperor Rubert. The Armed Archaeologists from the Intelligentsia Guild have provided evidence that stars seeded by the Tayzzyronth have irreparably become literal hellscapes, and their only end lies in obliteration by star destroyer arsenals to prevent future danger.[2] When Adlivun was attacked by the Swarm, it indirectly led to Nanook's ascension into Aeonhood.[14]\nAccording to Herta, Tayzzyronth may eventually resurface in the future.[15] This is further expanded upon by Fu Xuan in her writings Glimpses into the Beyond, wherein she recounts learning from a scholar that Tayzzyronth was sealed in amber. He showed her a piece of amber and claimed it was a part of the \"Imperator Insectorum's Prison Cell\" and the omniscia in Fu Xuan's forehead could not foresee the future of the item, corroborating the scholar's claims.[2]\nAfter Jingliu and Luocha revealed that they had smuggled the Stellaron onto the Luofu (which was a feint), an investigation led by Yaoguang revealed that they had a Godslayer Protocol to end Yaoshi — Luocha's coffin actually contained a fragment of Tayzzyronth's divine body, which would serve as the final nail in the Plague Author's fate and doom.[16]\nWhen Tayzzyronth appears in the Simulated Universe, the following sound will play: ▶\n...Tayzzyronth the Propagation! I don't know why Ruan Mei is so interested in THEM. Perhaps because THEY made such a ruckus with the Swarm Disaster THEY created. However, this creature is timid, slow-witted, and has no insight as an Aeon — THEIR mind is void of anything except reproduction, and even THEIR descendants are the same. In the days before the fall of Tayzzyronth, some had also attempted to breed the Swarm and make it think beyond mere propagation, but it seemed to have been a complete failure. They couldn't even put a shoe on themselves. Though, you have to hand it to Tayzzyronth. THEY went so far down the road of Propagation that just a little shiver could make the Swarm throughout the entire universe start a frantic, endless self-replication — seriously, why the overreaction? Since THEIR fall, there are still an endless number of the Swarm rampaging throughout the universe, and they are really annoying...\n...With the Propagation's intelligence, THEY probably didn't have a chance to realize how pitiful THEY were. Tayzzyronth fell quickly, just several Amber Eras after THEIR birth, leaving nothing behind in the universe except a Swarm as far as the eye can see. The only thing confirmed by the evidence is that there must have been something behind that cataclysmic massacre on Lepismat, but I'm afraid that even the one behind the act never anticipated for Tayzzyronth to ascend to godhood by \"chance.\" Or maybe the mastermind just didn't care. Now, what else but an Aeon could have played such a conniving role? Also, I made another discovery: It seems that, biologically, Tayzzyronth cannot be clearly classified into any of the genders present in sexually reproducing insect species. Does this discovery have any significance? It doesn't seem to. I'm just documenting it...\n"

Led by a charismatic woman, the bounty hunters went to Lepismat for an insect hunt supposedly to compile an insect chart however this might be a lie as it is hinted that they may have connections to Elation.[4][5]\nHowever, at some point, the ancient insects gradually drifted toward the brink of extinction. The only thing confirmed by the evidence is that there must have been something behind that cataclysmic massacre on Lepismat that lead to Tayzzyronth becoming the last member of the Coleoptera, causing him to ascend to Aeonhood and ignite the Path of Propagation out of a desire born from loneliness. After the disappearance of Long the Permanence, Tayzzyronth divided the Aeon's Path. In the process, they metamorphosed into a self-duplicating horror, leading to the Swarm Disaster.[6]\nDuring the Swarm Disaster, a war broke out between the Elydichan army and bounty hunters. The army used the insects as weapons due to their self-replicating abilities. Some insects was reproducing on the battlefield like a legion that regenerates infinitely, other insects were colossal and was used to purge the surface of all hostile entities.[7]\nThe bounty hunters on Lepismat turned on each other as the hallucinations caused by the swarm made it impossible to differentiate between their allies and the swarm. This caused a massacre on the planet.[4]\nAfter the destruction subsides, Sin Thirsters emerged from the void, feeding on the sense of guilt.[8]\n"

During this time, a group of Bounty hunters tried their best to coordinate and regroup and eventually open a bar.[9] The male Bounty Hunter who killed his lover would eventually accidently land on a random location and mourn.[10]\nAfter the Swarm Disaster, numerous Bounty Hunters who partook in the massacre on Lepismat reported washing their hands of multicolored blood every since.[11] This extents even to a Bounty Hunter's Sin Thirster, whose unable to clean it's hands even after 9087 times.[4]\n"

They are the remains of the Aeon of Propagation, Tayzzyronth, and appear in the form of flying, four-winged insects.\nSir Duroy, a member of the Intelligentsia Guild, explored the starry seas and authored the thirty-volume of the Chronicles of Interdimensional Insects. The book provides detailed records of over a dozen confirmed species of lepisma and countless subspecies spanning across the stars.[1]\nTrue Stings emit fibrous particles from their wings during flight — the inhalation of which can induce perceptual distortions and hallucinations. These visions feed on people's subjective experiences and long-term sentiments in order to take the form of what they personally desire.[2]\nSome units of the Swarm have transformed into ground combat units. They have sacrificed flight for colossal size and hardened carapaces. These units often serve as the shock troops of the Swarm Invasion, using their massive bodies to break through defenses.[3]\nSwarm Kings were high ranked descendants of Tayzzyronth.\nStarcrusher Swarm King: Skaracabaz was a giant lepisma that was ascended to be Emanator of the Propagation and inherited the mandibles of Tayzzyronth. It can collect in its mouthparts the death ray that fragmented celestial bodies, and make shattered stars incubators for procreating offspring. It was once one of the nightmares across multiple worlds during the Swarm Disaster. A synthetic form was later created by Ruan Mei, though it died 56 seconds after breaking out of its incubator due to not being able to sustain itself.[4]\nAfterglow Swarm King was mentioned in the Curio Ancient Communications. During the Swarm Disaster, a group of bounty hunters that pursued worker bugs captured lone Afterglow Stings and modified them into frontline communications devices. With varying levels of stimulation, pheromone sensors that ignore distance would cause the insect to change color in real time and allow for simple information exchange. With this secret code, the bounty hunters became more and more courageous on the battlefield, until they came face-to-face with the Afterglow Swarm King attracted by the pheromones.[5]\n"

Although THEY are present in almost every significant event of the universe, THEY rarely manifest in front of mortals.\nFuli manifests as a humanoid figure carved out of a reflective crystal material wearing a mianguan.\nThe Eden of Blessed Insight, also known as the Pure Land of Recollection, is the realm of Fuli. In the tales whispered among the Memokeepers, Fuli will blend the most luminous and lavish memories into the Eden of Blessed Insight, and they shall serve to reshape the entirety of the world after its annihilation.[2] This realm has also shown a capability to see the future.[3]\nWhen both the paths of Remembrance and Enigmata entertwine, the place known as the Dreamscape comes into existence.[4]\nMemokeepers from the Garden of Recollection are dedicated to preserving and sharing memories. Enlightened by their master Fuli, Memokeepers shed their mortal flesh and live on as memetic entities. With this unique gift from Fuli, they can freely traverse between worlds, unconstrained by physical limits.[5]\nSome people claim that Fuli ascended during the conflict between Tayzzyronth and Oroboros in the Swarm Disaster, in order to preserve the moment of the stars' demise. However, Herta considers this claim may have been fabricated by History Fictionologists.[6] Furthermore, Memory Bubbles existed before the Swarm Disaster,[7] which suggests that the Garden of Recollection was already active at that time. This would require the existence of Fuli before the Swarm Disaster.\nDuring Louis Fleming's retirement speech, Fuli manifested in the crowd, and due to THEIR presence, the Candelagraphos was able to note three revelations coming from Nous, Terminus, and Mythus.[8]\nWhen Fuli appears in the Simulated Universe, the following sound will play: ▶\n...There are plenty of mysterious Aeons in the universe, and Fuli is particularly enigmatic. Nobody in the entire Genius Society and the IPC and the Intelligentsia Guild knows when THEY were even born. The Aeon of Remembrance had quietly appeared in the annals of the universe as if THEY were meant to be here, as if THEY had altered everyone's memory. Fuli rarely presents THEMSELF before mortals. According to video evidence, THEY visually look like a humanoid figure carved out of crystal, with indistinguishable facial features and wearing a diadem with a curtain of pearls covering THEIR face. The appearance of Fuli the Remembrance always signals an important event is about to happen, but I think maybe the cause and effect should be flipped — Perhaps Fuli only shows up to record that event in the universe's memories...?\n...Fortunately, the one time that Fuli's arrival was recorded was the last public appearance of Louis Fleming, the founder and lifetime honorable Board member of the Interastral Peace Corporation. Therefore, the IPC's archives preserved the complete recording of the Aeon's manifestation from the start to the end. Old Fleming was giving a speech at the time and declaring he was going to permanently retire from all official and unofficial events. Given how old he was, he was probably tired of living. But just as he was finishing the speech, there was suddenly a rainbow-colored light that threw everyone into disarray. Like a wraith that appeared in thin air, Fuli the Remembrance had condensed into being before Louis Fleming. The human representing wealth and the Aeon representing remembrance briefly locked eyes with each other. Maybe they exchanged some words, or maybe they didn't — The recording didn't manage to catch that. Fuli then disappeared, and Louis Fleming turned and walked off the stage, never to be seen again. Seriously, out of everyone who had faced an Aeon, that old man was the calmest I've seen. Even Screwllum's gears squeaked when he saw Nous...\n...Fuli, THEY are really hard to fathom. I doubt that the birth of the Remembrance is related to that widespread and vast fall of the stars. That final wailing and screams of countless lives before their demise shook me to the core. Alas, it was all the doing of Oroboros the Voracity! To be honest, everyone thought THEY were just a clumsy Leviathan, like how Qlipoth was thought to be an oversized statue. Who would have guessed that THEIR body has multiple forms? I suspect that there is a dimension unknown to humanity under the dark tides that gave birth to THEM. Oh, and THEIR abdomen, too — it is said that no species can resist the lantern-like “bait” on Oroboros’s body, and that countless galaxies are already in THEIR stomach, with only the “memories” of those that perished being left behind thanks to Fuli...\n"

They are the closest family there is and believe there should never be contradictions or noisy disputes. Only with eternal love and smiles will the universe become a harmonious whole. The Family frequently calls out to other worlds with their song, encouraging them to embrace Harmony. The Family will celebrate each new world that accepts the blessing of Xipe, and work even harder at praising the Aeon's kindness. The Family has never known any world that grew weary of the singing and voluntarily abandoned the Path of Harmony.[7]\nPenacony is a chapter of The Family. Its spokesperson is Sunday.[7] Penacony, Land of the Dreams, is an intergalactic hotel. The real Penacony is in the Dreamscape that is entered through the Dreampool in The Reverie Hotel. The Penacony of the Dreamscape is crafted through the combined efforts of Family members, Dreamchasers, and guests.[8]\nAs Sunday later revealed his plan of placing everyone in a perfect dream, he was confronted by the Trailblazer, Himeko, March 7th and Firefly.[9] When the Trailblazer received the legacy from the Watchmaker, they were gazed by Xipe and thus acquired the Path of Harmony.[10]\nThe Harmonic Strings are the multiple embodiments of Xipe. They are the down-to-earth virtues that enable harmony. Some believe that the Harmonic Strings are Emanators of Xipe. However they do not follow any specific mortal but are facets of Xipe and can assume any Family member when necessary. The names of the embodiment of Xipe are: Aelenev the commander of the Eternal Centurion, Dominicus the wisher of the Harmonious Choir, Constantina the singer of the Panacoustic Theater, and Beatriz the merrymaker of the Blissfull Ball. Few have seen them outside The Family.[11]\nWhen Xipe appears in the Simulated Universe, the following sound will play: ▶\n...Xipe the Harmony. Oh, the mother of all stars! THEY proclaimed harmonious hymns of celebration, and united all wills as one. The Family's songs spread to all corners of the world, and THEIR degree of understanding, support, and synergy for the will of all creatures was beyond imagination. Or perhaps, THEY were already on a plane beyond mortal minds. The ever-expanding Harmony was truly worthy of human longing. The universe encircles and decorates THEIR body like crushed diamonds, and civilization became a rainbow to be snatched in THEIR palm. I am filled with curiosity about how THEY swallowed up Order. The hymns of Xipe continue to spread and grow, occasionally overseen by ideology. In contrast, Ena's harmonic songs seems to align within a three-dimensional framework, akin to an emperor maintaining hierarchical order among all creatures. While there may be some overlap between THEIR Paths, the ancient Order is enormous in size, and swallowing THEM would prove far from effortless... Among the Aeons, there exist countless enigmas that surpass my own speculations.\n"

        "content": "The Mechanical Emperor's Wars, also known as the Anti-Organic Wars, are a series of two wars which engulfed half the cosmos and plunged many civilizations into abject ruin. The first war was initiated by Rubert I after it assembled an army of intelligent robots and spread the Anti-Organic Equation throughout the universe with the goal of eradicating organic life.[1]\nThe Second Emperor's War, sometimes referred to as the Second Rubert Rebellion[2] or the Second Machine Crisis,[3] was initiated by Rubert II.\nAfter the Swarm Disaster, the Interastral Peace Corporation went through a reorganization through the efforts of the collaboration between two IPC executives, Korapao of the Cargo Division and Telora Farnsha from the Trade Division that would result in a mass expansion.[4] However, conflict began to build up between two, leading to the Borderstar Trade War,[5] as according to the first unchangeable moment of Nous' calculations.[6]\nFollowing the outbreak of the war, Fuli the Remembrance emerged during the IPC founder Louis Fleming's retirement speech. As memories surfaced from THEIR presence, the Candelagraphos of the Intelligentsia Guild wrote down three paragraphs about the memories, drawing three revelations. The first was Nous' calculation: The universe will undergo three unchangable moments, the first of which had already happened with the start of the Boardstar Trade War. The second was the Finality's prediction: A silk accessory suitable for women will bring about the end of the war. The third was the Enigmata's riddle: THEY leave no question, but the answers are “blood” and “flower.” After evaluating the three revelations of the Aeons, the Candelagraphos believed it would lead to an equation, and some divisions of the IPC began to carry out construction in inorganic life zones.[7]\nLater, a computer discarded in a graveyard awoke from the landfill after gaining self-awareness.[6] After breaking out of the graveyard with a cannon created from scraps,[8] Rubert began to persistently improve its computational system. Eventually, it arrived at the conclusion that the algorithm of organic beings are inherently flawed, and saw little value in their existence. Believing that the calculations performed by them will forever be riddled with errors, Rubert proclaimed the Machine Empire and crowned itself as emperor to combat the organic lifeforms.[1] Charged with hatred and aspiration to rid the cosmos of imperfect beings, Rubert I initiated the Mechanical Emperor's Wars while the Borderstar Trade War was still undergoing.[6]\nBefore the creation of the anti-life equation, the Mechanical Empire used brute force against organic life.[9] During the wars, the Tottonids were eradicated by organic creatures for siding with the Mechas.[10]\nBy rapidly improving its computing power, Rubert eventually discovered the Anti-Organic Equation.[1] This equation could be infiltrate minds of beings without noticeable effects. However, when activated in inorganic beings, it corrupts their consciousness, aligning them with the emperor's goal of exterminating all organic life in the universe.[11]\nAfter this, for unknown reasons, Rubert fell into a slumber. Aha the Elation and Mythus the Enigmata watched on as the Machine Empire crumbled in its absence. However, Rubert was eventually awakened by a group of organic beings walking on the Trailblaze while they were traversing into the Mechanical City. As it rose from slumber, the inorganic lives implanted with the Anti-Organic Equation was activitated, forcing them to instinctively kill any organic beings.[12]\nThe equation was later discovered in some organic beings plundering resources from other planets by the Technology Division of the IPC, leading them to conclude that the equation did not follow thoughts, but altered them.[11] It's able to make inorganic beings question their humanity and convince organics that they were machines. Later, Korapao and his subordinates in the Cargo Division attempted to decipher the logic behind the equation, succeeding to synthesize a replica of it. He ordered his organic subordinates to have the replica implanted into their minds to avail the benefits of inorganic lives.[5] The sheer complexity of this equation attracted the gaze of Nous, and Rubert was sent an invitation to the Genius Society by the Aeon, becoming its 27th member. This fulfilled the second moment as calculated by the Erudition.[6]\nAccording to Rubert's equation, the Philosopher Union that controlled the Laurel Wreath Galaxy was certain to be destroyed by the Machine Empire. The the inorganic lives within the Union fell under the influence of the Anti-Organic Equation was driven to exterminate all organic beings around them, erupting a civil war between inorganic and organic lifeforms in the Galaxy.[13] The inorganic lifeforms imprisoned the leader of the Union, Aurelius, in the Union's meeting place, then executed him in the name of Rubert and the Machine Empire by the means of lethal poisoning as humiliation for being the sole representative and leader of all living beings in the galaxy.[14] Left without a leader, the organic lives was soon defeated and the Union was reduced it to the domain of inorganic life.[15] The countless number of scholars died in this event led the IPC to deem this occurrence \"Rationality's Fall\".[13]\nFollowers of Elation started a riot after the fall of the Union, infecting Rubert's computer system with a troll virus called the \"Philosopher's Poison\" and overthrowing the local robot army.[15] Later, the Stellaron Hunters disseminated the virus across all of the Golcondar's colonies to take their Stellaron, causing millions of inorganic entities to turn into rampant machines.[16]\nIn Year 3287 Star Calendar, the Aurumatons unleashed a slaughter against the Xianzhou Alliance under the influence of Rubert, following the Civil War of the Xianzhou Yuanqiao. The coarse and the venerable reached an agreement and united forces to fight the Aurumatons' rebellion. In 3290, Zhige, the master primus of the aurumaton, led a force aboard the Xianzhou Yaoqing. Their combined forces launched an offensive operation, shattering the Aurumatons into pieces. All of the remaining aurumatons were herded into the arsenal and suppressed by talismans, stripping them of self-awareness. Those disassembled while retaining the ability to think had all records of the era eradicated from their Jade Abacus to make sure they pose no further threat in the future.[17][18]\nOut of belief that Nous' calculations are absolute, Genius Society member #4 Polka Kakamond took it upon to carry out the final moment of THEIR calculation.[19] From the onset of the war, she already began to conspire in Rubert's death. At the invitation of the IPC, she interrogated mechanical overlord Ludia Perthesius of the Machine Empire, seeking whereabouts regarding Rubert.[20] Although she made numerous attempts on Rubert's life before, none came to avail.[19] Only after the war had raged on for several Amber Eras did the moment Nous had foreseen arrive and allow her to succeeded.[21]\nDespite the efforts made by HooH the Equilibrium and Mythus the Enigmata to challenge Nous' calculations and alter its fate, all that changed was the angle at which Polka's scalpel pierced Rubert's chest. As the third moment occurred, Emperor Rubert I's gargantuan body collapsed along with its empire. Its death marked the end of the First Mechanical Emperor's War and fulfilled the Finality's predictions.[22]\nIn the aftermath of the war, rumors spread that Rubert was either taken out by Polka Kakamond or an assassin hired by the Interastral Peace Corporation,[1] but both may have been true. It was later revealed that the co-founder of the Corporation Dongfang Qixing had associated himself with Polka Kakamond, leveraging her political influence and keeping the war in control with omens, possibly relating to the Finality.[23]\nMany years following the death of Rubert I and the end of the First Emperor's War, a human visited its grave and solved the Anti-Organic Equation during his stay. Despite successfully deriving the solution thousands of times, he refused to speak of its answer, well aware of the consequences should the equation be activated. As a result, his achievement was met with doubt and he remained just as impoverish as before he set off. Soon after his return, he found himself plagued by increasingly negative thoughts, which not only affected his mind but also manifest physically in his limbs and torso. Suddenly, it occurred to him that all organic lives were machines made for deceptive purposes, while he was the only being with free will. In a morose declaration, he resolved that he would carry on Rubert I's will to eradicate all organic lives from the cosmos.[24]\nAlthough it's likely that this man was Rubert II, who professed to have inherited the memories of Rubert I and initiated the second Emperor's War,[25] Ruan Mei claimed that it's impossible for Rubert II to exist during the First Emperor's War, as it occurred far too long ago.[6] Not much is known of the Second Emperor's War onwards.\nDuring the first war, the inhabitants of Adlivun were left devastated by the Machine Empire before it entered in another struggle with the remnants of The Swarm. The destruction brought by both conflicts led to the ascension of Nanook as an Aeon.[26] Many antiques of high value were also destroyed, such as the Last Phonograph of Order created by Beyond the Sky Choir.[27]\nAfter the Second Rubert Rebellion, the IPC invested vast amounts of credits to repeatedly investigate the remains of Rubert II. To their surprise, Rubert II was found to be an organic being.[25]\nThe comparable damage inflicted by these two wars to that of the Swarm Disaster prompted the IPC to consider the extermination of all mechanical life forms across the cosmos. However, before the plan was passed, the they heard that Screwllum, a mechanical life-form, was selected by Nous to join the Genius Society as member #76. They gifted Screwllum the Mechanical Cuckoo Clock as a symbol of peace.[2]\nScrewllum actively opposes Rubert, and continues to do so today.[28]\n"

        "content": "The Mechanical Emperor's Wars, also known as the Anti-Organic Wars, are a series of two wars which engulfed half the cosmos and plunged many civilizations into abject ruin. The first war was initiated by Rubert I after it assembled an army of intelligent robots and spread the Anti-Organic Equation throughout the universe with the goal of eradicating organic life.[1]\nThe Second Emperor's War, sometimes referred to as the Second Rubert Rebellion[2] or the Second Machine Crisis,[3] was initiated by Rubert II.\nAfter the Swarm Disaster, the Interastral Peace Corporation went through a reorganization through the efforts of the collaboration between two IPC executives, Korapao of the Cargo Division and Telora Farnsha from the Trade Division that would result in a mass expansion.[4] However, conflict began to build up between two, leading to the Borderstar Trade War,[5] as according to the first unchangeable moment of Nous' calculations.[6]\nFollowing the outbreak of the war, Fuli the Remembrance emerged during the IPC founder Louis Fleming's retirement speech. As memories surfaced from THEIR presence, the Candelagraphos of the Intelligentsia Guild wrote down three paragraphs about the memories, drawing three revelations. The first was Nous' calculation: The universe will undergo three unchangable moments, the first of which had already happened with the start of the Boardstar Trade War. The second was the Finality's prediction: A silk accessory suitable for women will bring about the end of the war. The third was the Enigmata's riddle: THEY leave no question, but the answers are “blood” and “flower.” After evaluating the three revelations of the Aeons, the Candelagraphos believed it would lead to an equation, and some divisions of the IPC began to carry out construction in inorganic life zones.[7]\nLater, a computer discarded in a graveyard awoke from the landfill after gaining self-awareness.[6] After breaking out of the graveyard with a cannon created from scraps,[8] Rubert began to persistently improve its computational system. Eventually, it arrived at the conclusion that the algorithm of organic beings are inherently flawed, and saw little value in their existence. Believing that the calculations performed by them will forever be riddled with errors, Rubert proclaimed the Machine Empire and crowned itself as emperor to combat the organic lifeforms.[1] Charged with hatred and aspiration to rid the cosmos of imperfect beings, Rubert I initiated the Mechanical Emperor's Wars while the Borderstar Trade War was still undergoing.[6]\nBefore the creation of the anti-life equation, the Mechanical Empire used brute force against organic life.[9] During the wars, the Tottonids were eradicated by organic creatures for siding with the Mechas.[10]\nBy rapidly improving its computing power, Rubert eventually discovered the Anti-Organic Equation.[1] This equation could be infiltrate minds of beings without noticeable effects. However, when activated in inorganic beings, it corrupts their consciousness, aligning them with the emperor's goal of exterminating all organic life in the universe.[11]\nAfter this, for unknown reasons, Rubert fell into a slumber. Aha the Elation and Mythus the Enigmata watched on as the Machine Empire crumbled in its absence. However, Rubert was eventually awakened by a group of organic beings walking on the Trailblaze while they were traversing into the Mechanical City. As it rose from slumber, the inorganic lives implanted with the Anti-Organic Equation was activitated, forcing them to instinctively kill any organic beings.[12]\nThe equation was later discovered in some organic beings plundering resources from other planets by the Technology Division of the IPC, leading them to conclude that the equation did not follow thoughts, but altered them.[11] It's able to make inorganic beings question their humanity and convince organics that they were machines. Later, Korapao and his subordinates in the Cargo Division attempted to decipher the logic behind the equation, succeeding to synthesize a replica of it. He ordered his organic subordinates to have the replica implanted into their minds to avail the benefits of inorganic lives.[5] The sheer complexity of this equation attracted the gaze of Nous, and Rubert was sent an invitation to the Genius Society by the Aeon, becoming its 27th member. This fulfilled the second moment as calculated by the Erudition.[6]\nAccording to Rubert's equation, the Philosopher Union that controlled the Laurel Wreath Galaxy was certain to be destroyed by the Machine Empire. The the inorganic lives within the Union fell under the influence of the Anti-Organic Equation was driven to exterminate all organic beings around them, erupting a civil war between inorganic and organic lifeforms in the Galaxy.[13] The inorganic lifeforms imprisoned the leader of the Union, Aurelius, in the Union's meeting place, then executed him in the name of Rubert and the Machine Empire by the means of lethal poisoning as humiliation for being the sole representative and leader of all living beings in the galaxy.[14] Left without a leader, the organic lives was soon defeated and the Union was reduced it to the domain of inorganic life.[15] The countless number of scholars died in this event led the IPC to deem this occurrence \"Rationality's Fall\".[13]\nFollowers of Elation started a riot after the fall of the Union, infecting Rubert's computer system with a troll virus called the \"Philosopher's Poison\" and overthrowing the local robot army.[15] Later, the Stellaron Hunters disseminated the virus across all of the Golcondar's colonies to take their Stellaron, causing millions of inorganic entities to turn into rampant machines.[16]\nIn Year 3287 Star Calendar, the Aurumatons unleashed a slaughter against the Xianzhou Alliance under the influence of Rubert, following the Civil War of the Xianzhou Yuanqiao. The coarse and the venerable reached an agreement and united forces to fight the Aurumatons' rebellion. In 3290, Zhige, the master primus of the aurumaton, led a force aboard the Xianzhou Yaoqing. Their combined forces launched an offensive operation, shattering the Aurumatons into pieces. All of the remaining aurumatons were herded into the arsenal and suppressed by talismans, stripping them of self-awareness. Those disassembled while retaining the ability to think had all records of the era eradicated from their Jade Abacus to make sure they pose no further threat in the future.[17][18]\nOut of belief that Nous' calculations are absolute, Genius Society member #4 Polka Kakamond took it upon to carry out the final moment of THEIR calculation.[19] From the onset of the war, she already began to conspire in Rubert's death. At the invitation of the IPC, she interrogated mechanical overlord Ludia Perthesius of the Machine Empire, seeking whereabouts regarding Rubert.[20] Although she made numerous attempts on Rubert's life before, none came to avail.[19] Only after the war had raged on for several Amber Eras did the moment Nous had foreseen arrive and allow her to succeeded.[21]\nDespite the efforts made by HooH the Equilibrium and Mythus the Enigmata to challenge Nous' calculations and alter its fate, all that changed was the angle at which Polka's scalpel pierced Rubert's chest. As the third moment occurred, Emperor Rubert I's gargantuan body collapsed along with its empire. Its death marked the end of the First Mechanical Emperor's War and fulfilled the Finality's predictions.[22]\nIn the aftermath of the war, rumors spread that Rubert was either taken out by Polka Kakamond or an assassin hired by the Interastral Peace Corporation,[1] but both may have been true. It was later revealed that the co-founder of the Corporation Dongfang Qixing had associated himself with Polka Kakamond, leveraging her political influence and keeping the war in control with omens, possibly relating to the Finality.[23]\nMany years following the death of Rubert I and the end of the First Emperor's War, a human visited its grave and solved the Anti-Organic Equation during his stay. Despite successfully deriving the solution thousands of times, he refused to speak of its answer, well aware of the consequences should the equation be activated. As a result, his achievement was met with doubt and he remained just as impoverish as before he set off. Soon after his return, he found himself plagued by increasingly negative thoughts, which not only affected his mind but also manifest physically in his limbs and torso. Suddenly, it occurred to him that all organic lives were machines made for deceptive purposes, while he was the only being with free will. In a morose declaration, he resolved that he would carry on Rubert I's will to eradicate all organic lives from the cosmos.[24]\nAlthough it's likely that this man was Rubert II, who professed to have inherited the memories of Rubert I and initiated the second Emperor's War,[25] Ruan Mei claimed that it's impossible for Rubert II to exist during the First Emperor's War, as it occurred far too long ago.[6] Not much is known of the Second Emperor's War onwards.\nDuring the first war, the inhabitants of Adlivun were left devastated by the Machine Empire before it entered in another struggle with the remnants of The Swarm. The destruction brought by both conflicts led to the ascension of Nanook as an Aeon.[26] Many antiques of high value were also destroyed, such as the Last Phonograph of Order created by Beyond the Sky Choir.[27]\nAfter the Second Rubert Rebellion, the IPC invested vast amounts of credits to repeatedly investigate the remains of Rubert II. To their surprise, Rubert II was found to be an organic being.[25]\nThe comparable damage inflicted by these two wars to that of the Swarm Disaster prompted the IPC to consider the extermination of all mechanical life forms across the cosmos. However, before the plan was passed, the they heard that Screwllum, a mechanical life-form, was selected by Nous to join the Genius Society as member #76. They gifted Screwllum the Mechanical Cuckoo Clock as a symbol of peace.[2]\nScrewllum actively opposes Rubert, and continues to do so today.[28]\n"

Later on, it was discovered that it can also affect organic lifeforms such as Rubert II and several of the people from fringe planets by the Interastral Peace Corporation's Technology Division.[2][3]\nThose previously affected with the equation and survived felt equal pain return to their dreams, night after night, due to their destitution and trauma. Sometimes the pain was as dim as candlelights and other times they jumped out and almost took human form. The survivors felt like their blood filled with venom as it is transferred to their limbs, brains and hearts.[4]\nIt is presumed that wiping the memory clean of the time period of the mechanical wars can remove traces of the Equation from the species infected by it. [5]\nThe Anti-Organic Equation can assist mechanical lifeforms in performing calculations that can destroy organic lifeforms.[6] The activation of the Equation can also lead mechanical lifeforms to kill other mechanical lifeforms, and affects organic lifeforms to think like Rubert I.[2][3]\nThe synthetic Equation created by Professor Cressitra accessed the benefits of mechanical lifeforms to organic lives.[7]\nThe Anti-Organic Virus created by Crouch Osmo is a virus which possessed the qualities of the Equation. It is transmitted through magnetic waves.[8][9]\nDuring the Borderstar Trade Wars, Fuli's Eden of Blessed Insight would prophesize that a horrifying war will erupt when an anti-virus program is activated. This was the Anti-Organic Equation.[10]\nIn a graveyard, Rubert I awakened, with a damaged logic unit, an old engine, 90 GB worth of RAM left, and an arm with one movable finger, he busted out of the graveyard. After these events, he developed the Anti-Organic Equation, and recieved the gaze of Nous and became part of the Genius Society.[11]\nEventually, Korapao, the leader of the Cargo Division, instructed a doctor to derive the Anti-Organic Equation, which was met with failure. However, they synthesized a different Anti-Organic Equation, which Korapao used after Prof. Cressitra, who blew up his long-distance vessel, by implanting it on their subordinates.[4][7]\nIn an area previously untouched by the Equation, a couple lived in peace, yet when the Equation activated, the wife killed the husband. This led De Wayne's subordinates to conclude that machinery with human appearance can still be affected by the Equation. After that, it was discovered that the Equation was also in other organic lives originating from fringe planets. And so, it was concluded that the Equation was to alter thoughts.[2]\nYears after Rubert I's death, a human would visit his grave. This human would go on to solve the Anti-Organic Equation, and a History Fictionologist would write that this person derived the answer 5368 times, yet nobody would believe him. He went increasingly insane as his mind and body is riddled with bad things, until he finally decided to kill all organic lifeforms. This person supposedly became Rubert II.[3]\nDuring the Scholars' Strife, Scholar Crouch Omno accidentally synthesized the \"Anti-Organic Virus\", while trying to create a hybrid that possesses the advantages of both organic and inorganic lifeforms.[8] Eventually, the Virus was quelled at the cost of destroying 122 Scepters.[9]\n"

These traits of hers can be seen in the Yaoqing's aggressive pursuit of Abominations of Abundance, as they once secured victory against five different abomination forces within a single year, 8098 Star Calendar.[4] The Yaoqing is noted for its martial prowess and is rarely rivaled.[5] This may be due to the fact that the borisin still have many enslaved Foxians and they still fight tirelessly for the liberation of their kin.\nThe Xianzhou Yaoqing has a majority-foxian population.[6] Many travelers have asked if it is safe to travel to the Xianzhou Yaoqing. However, the military operations of the Yaoqing is mainly done by the expeditionary fleet and will not endanger the main ship. Of course, that doesn't mean the Denizens of Abundance will not target the ship, which they describe as a \"catastrophe\". It is said that no enemies have ever managed to deal any substantial damage to the Yaoqing's main ship since the last Amber Era. It is still vital for travelers to strictly abide by the Yaoqing's regulations during the trip. The ship advances at a dazzling speed, carrying the momentum of tempest and thunder. Countless Foxians, fully armed, stand on the deck in a majestic posture.[7]\nNo unnecessary extra procedures are needed to visit the Xianzhou Yaoqing. As long as you are a Xianzhou Alliance citizen or a holder of the Xianzhou Alliance Travel Pass or Resident Permit, you are allowed to visit the Yaoqing. Considering that the Yaoqing is often sailing through active war zones, it is advised to prepare more safety measures before departure. A Yaoqing tour is available with Star-Picking Tours. It is still vital for travelers to strictly abide by the Yaoqing's regulations during the trip. Unauthorized departure from the tour group may constitute a violation of law or even a criminal offense.[8] The Foxians of the Xianzhou Yaoqing are known for their adventuring flying families. The most renowned of these families was that of Baiheng's.[9] There is a Royal Academy on the Yaoqing that Mr. Xiyan studied at.[10]\nThe Xianzhou Yaoqing had much closer ties with the IPC than the Xianzhou Luofu. Initially, people thought they were just engaging in a little interstellar investment but over time, things changed. Gradually, the Yaoqing's younger generations began to enjoy the immersia produced by the IPC's Entertainment Division. Once they started wearing IPC clothing lines, it was hard to tell if they were Xianzhou locals or IPC employees. After their Coming of Age Ceremonies, many youths aspired to join the IPC to make it big. The architecture across the whole delve began to change. The graceful flying eaves, glazed tiles and Fallow Earth bricks were slowly replaced by sleek, monolithic IPC buildings. Many of the Yaoqing locals older than 500 would say the Yaoqing has changed, though they're not sure whether this change would lead to a better future, or if it would allow short-life species to dictate their way of life, causing anxiety amongst the populace.[11]\nCloud poria grown on the Yaoqing can be used for Stone Calf Cimicifugae Infusion.[12] The Longevity Pill of Cruelty is a medicine exclusive to the Yaoqing that is said to have the effect of improving overall fitness and rendering those who take it immune to all diseases for a short period of time.[13] It was rumored military rations aboard the Yaoqing include dried Mineshrooms.[14] Starskiff seed research conducted in the Yaoqing unexpectedly produced a glowing flower that is delicious, sugar-free, and fat-free, and bears fruits once every thousand years or so and can also be used as a chandelier for lighting. The flower is a popular product throughout the cosmos and have earned a handsome amount of foreign currencies for the alliance. The Intelligentsia Guild believes that the flower is very likely to have different moods as the brightness of its glow will change for no reason.[15]\nThe Caelorum Venti Pavilion in Moon Delve is one of the most well-known tourist sites of the Yaoqing. The place commemorates how the previous Caelorum Venti, high elder of the Yaoqing, fought valiantly and slew an herd abomination named the Hundred Hands. It took the Artisanship Commission of the Yaoqing and 3,000 Vidyadhara craftsmen more than 20 years to build the pavilion with large slabs of jade and moonstone. It is hailed as the epitome of the Yaoqing Vidyadhara architectural style, and it is said no language can describe its exquisiteness and grandeur adequately. Vidyadhara Windsayers have laid a \"Feather Path\" in the pavilion that links 16 floating islands together to allow people to walk freely in the air without any flying or floating equipment.[8]\nThe Verdant Harbor in the Verdant Delve showcases the Yaoqing's unique starskiff manufacturing process. A guide can take visitors through the entire place to see how the \"furry little creatures\" grow to become loyal partners of the Verdant Knights that are capable of eradicating abominations. New starskiffs are born almost every day. With the help of the staff, Star-Picking Tours visitors can get the chance to deliver a new starskiff and experience the \"miracle of biotechnology\". Visitors might even get to name the new starskiff, which may be seen eliminating Denizens of Abundance on the battlefield in a few short months.[8]\nDescribed as an elegant and soothing activity, the most authentic and traditional \"Pacify Play\" on Baiheng Street is available at Red Fox Theater. Pacify Play is a traditional theater performance of the Yaoqing Foxians. The theater's stage is described as vast and circular. They need a large stage to be able to showcase all elements of the play as the Red Fox Theater is one of the few that rejects the use of special effects to preserve their millennium-old traditions.\nThis type of traditional opera uses different types of facial makeup to differentiate the characters and their personalities, so it requires some prior knowledge to be able to understand the story. Still, it is said that there should be no problem experiencing the charm of the play as it boasts super-realistic stage combat scenes where dozens of actors will find themselves moving around in midair, or acting out gunfights and physical struggles.[8]\nThe Ranzhi School is a medicinal school on the Xianzhou Yaoqing that specializes in food therapy.[16] In the Ranzhi School's medical theory, medicine is food, and vice versa, believing that the right food for the right ailments would naturally cure oneself.[17]\nRainsoar Lake has misty rain, yellow floating heart foliage and blossoms decorating the lake as frolicking fishes leap out of the water from time to time. At this lakeside abounds with lotuses and water chestnuts, old turtles basking on the pebbles were an everyday sight. Jiaoqiu would come here to gather ingredients such as floating heart plants and picked out lotus flowers for medicinal dishes.[18] Rainsoar Eatery was a restaurant operated by Jiaoqiu after he retired from being a military healer presumably named after Rainsoar lake, though it is unknown if it is operational.[19]\nThe Shackling Prison on the Xianzhou Yaoqing is completely different from the one on the Xianzhou Luofu, which is underwater, according to Jiaoqiu. Moze's comment implies that it may be in the clouds.[20]\nIn the Theophany Era, on December, Year 2607 Star Calendar, the Xianzhou Yaoqing, alongside the Fanghu and Zhuming, introduced its own Yellowjacket Census and Almanacs, advising of all death revitalizations on Xianzhou for that year. During the Three Sufferings Era on August, Year 3063 Star Calendar, a businessman is assassinated aboard the Yaoqing, plunging everyone into turmoil. At some point after that, the first case of mara-struck is recorded in history, the Yaoqing's Master of the Delves Changhuan, when he celebrated his thousandth birthday party. On May, Year 3290 Star Calendar, during the aurumaton revolt, Zhige, the master primus of the aurumaton, leads a force of brave fighters aboard the Xianzhou Yaoqing. The combined forces team up and launch an offensive operation, smashing them to smithereens.[21]\nDuring the Era of Bloodshed, the Xianzhou Alliance encountered a Dyson tree, also the mortal enemy of the Primeval Imperium — Muldrasil, homeland of the Wingweavers, feeding off nearby stars, and a war breaks out as a result. Fatigued from the Civil War, the aurumaton rebellion, and their emigration plan, all the prisoners in cryo-hibernation are released to counter the invasion — including the Reignbow who made a deal with the Flint Emperor, allowing the latter to possess their physical body, in exchange for the power of the Heliobi. Inspired by the Reignbow's sacrifice, the Xianzhou residents make the same deal, forming suicide squads and marching alongside the Heliobi. During the battle, the Reignbow shot their Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow from the bow of the Yaoqing, which was closest to Muldrasil in the battle formation and usied their famed bow \"Xuanyuan\", causing great casualties among even the furthest ships, the Xuling and Fanghu. The arrow smashes into the Ambrosial Arbor, penetrating Muldrasil.[22]\nIn The Year 4800 of the Star Calendar, the five lineages of the Vidyadhara made alliance on the Yuque, putting their sacred vow into writing. \"This oath shall remain unbroken, standing stronger than even earth and steel.\" Caelorum Venti was bound to watch over the Lunar Embryo on the Yaoqing.[23] At some point, Caelorum Venti fought and slew a herd abomination named the Hundred Hands. It took the Artisanship Commission of the Yaoqing and 3,000 Vidyadhara craftsmen more than 20 years to build the Caelorum Venti Pavilion in the Moon Delve with large slabs of jade and moonstone to commemorate the event.[8]\nAfter the Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae in the Year 7379 Star Calendar, Caelorum Venti made a deal with the Xianzhou Alliance that the Imbibitor Lunae of the Luofu, Dan Feng, was to be spared from death and instead suffer the punishment of molting rebirth, where he should have been regarded as a new being and his sins forgiven. However, the Ten-Lords Commission detained him in the Shackling Prison and General Jing Yuan banished him from the Luofu.[24] The Yaoqing laid out an encirclement and eradication of abominations in coordination with the Yuque's defense during an unnamed conflict on Thalassa. The Heroncrest Fleet of the Yaoqing was deployed instead of the Fanghu as they were too far away, and the current forces would have to withstand multiple counterattacks from the enemy for six months before the Fanghu arrived. They pressed a strong offense for some time, but lost any hope of success thereafter due to the Devil Tide of Thalassa.[5]\nAt some point in history, the Yaoqing, alongside the Fanghu and Zhuming, engaged in warfare against Lord Ravager Celenova and her troops.[25][26] In the year 8072 Star Calendar, during the Third Abundance War, the Yaoqing and Fanghu alerted the Luofu about the assembly of the Denizens of Abundance, the revival of Ketu Mirage; the roaming star and their attack on the Fanghu. The Luofu dispatched four brigades of Cloud Knights to help them fight but they were still facing defeat. Diviner Fu Xuan came up with a plan to use the Xianzhou Yuque's Cloudpeer Telescope to call Reignbow Arbiter.[27]\nThe Reignbow Arbiter then descended onto the battlefield and annihilated the borisins' fleet using their Lux Arrow, During the course of this battle, the Xianzhou Luofu lost over 63,000 fighter jets and over 120,000 pilots, and nearly one-fifth of the Xianzhou Fanghu's delves are destroyed by the Lux Arrow's bombardment. The extent of the damage to the Yaoqing's forces is unknown, however, the previous General of the Yaoqing were among those perished in Lan's bombardment as she was in the vicinity of the Cloudpeer Telescope. Sometime after, Feixiao took up office.[28][29]\nDuring a regular transmission on May, Year 8098 Star Calendar, the Xianzhou Yaoqing reported a resounding victory against Fallomom's abominations.  In June of that year, they secured a resounding victory against Toste-VIII's abominations. On October that year, they secured a resounding victory against Sakin Chadu's abominations, victory was uncertain until support from the Interastral Peace Corporation arrived. Madam Yukong advised the Yaoqing's Sky-Faring Commission to take appropriate recuperation measures; which in November of that year, the Xianzhou Yaoqing moored in the Sakin Chadu star system in Kersarran star cluster and cooperated with the Interastral Peace Corporation to harness local minerals and recuperate. On December of that year, the Yaoqing secured another resounding victory against Asmodeus' abominations.[4]\n4 Characters match the category selection:\n"

This was due to their barbaric nature being met with high resistance from natives of places they went to. To combat this, the Interastral Peace Corporation gave the group large quantities of basic protection gears which lowered the casualty rate by 9.72% on paper.[3]\nAt a point either before or during the Swarm Disaster, a Armed Archaeologist who had researched Lepismat was murdered, leaving a note containing all their findings.[4]\nSometime after the Swarm Disaster, the Armed Archaeologists were sent out to the Machine Empire which contained Intellitrons, beasts of the future, collective machines, and more inorganic life forms. However the Masked Fools had already infiltered the Machine Empire and used their influence to drive away the Armed Archaeologists.[5]\nA group of Armed Archaeologists once arrived to investigate the galaxy hosting Izumo and Takamagahara, however they found nothing but Enigmata due to both planets being destroyed.[6]\nThe Armed Archaeologists discovered Meteoric Bullets which with radioactive dating appeared to be from a time before humanity.[7]\nRecently, a group of Armed Archaeologists dispatched to Hellem discovered a miniature galaxy in a cave located near the planet's southern tropical latitudes. The group were conducting demolition missions on certain mountain ranges when they discovered a curious facility in the shape of a container. They are currently trying to get in contact with the population of the galaxy.[8]\nWith help from Genius Society member Screwllum, the Armed Archaeologists lead by Allen Jones are planning to excavate the tomb of Rubert I. The tomb ranks as Category Omega ranking on the Potential Disaster Index and is said to \"house the inventions inspired by the imagination of Rubert I.\" The Intelligentsia Guild hopes that with this mission more knowledge can be discovered on Rubert I, and that the universe may be better equipped for when he returns.[1]\n"

        "content": "The Mechanical Emperor's Wars, also known as the Anti-Organic Wars, are a series of two wars which engulfed half the cosmos and plunged many civilizations into abject ruin. The first war was initiated by Rubert I after it assembled an army of intelligent robots and spread the Anti-Organic Equation throughout the universe with the goal of eradicating organic life.[1]\nThe Second Emperor's War, sometimes referred to as the Second Rubert Rebellion[2] or the Second Machine Crisis,[3] was initiated by Rubert II.\nAfter the Swarm Disaster, the Interastral Peace Corporation went through a reorganization through the efforts of the collaboration between two IPC executives, Korapao of the Cargo Division and Telora Farnsha from the Trade Division that would result in a mass expansion.[4] However, conflict began to build up between two, leading to the Borderstar Trade War,[5] as according to the first unchangeable moment of Nous' calculations.[6]\nFollowing the outbreak of the war, Fuli the Remembrance emerged during the IPC founder Louis Fleming's retirement speech. As memories surfaced from THEIR presence, the Candelagraphos of the Intelligentsia Guild wrote down three paragraphs about the memories, drawing three revelations. The first was Nous' calculation: The universe will undergo three unchangable moments, the first of which had already happened with the start of the Boardstar Trade War. The second was the Finality's prediction: A silk accessory suitable for women will bring about the end of the war. The third was the Enigmata's riddle: THEY leave no question, but the answers are “blood” and “flower.” After evaluating the three revelations of the Aeons, the Candelagraphos believed it would lead to an equation, and some divisions of the IPC began to carry out construction in inorganic life zones.[7]\nLater, a computer discarded in a graveyard awoke from the landfill after gaining self-awareness.[6] After breaking out of the graveyard with a cannon created from scraps,[8] Rubert began to persistently improve its computational system. Eventually, it arrived at the conclusion that the algorithm of organic beings are inherently flawed, and saw little value in their existence. Believing that the calculations performed by them will forever be riddled with errors, Rubert proclaimed the Machine Empire and crowned itself as emperor to combat the organic lifeforms.[1] Charged with hatred and aspiration to rid the cosmos of imperfect beings, Rubert I initiated the Mechanical Emperor's Wars while the Borderstar Trade War was still undergoing.[6]\nBefore the creation of the anti-life equation, the Mechanical Empire used brute force against organic life.[9] During the wars, the Tottonids were eradicated by organic creatures for siding with the Mechas.[10]\nBy rapidly improving its computing power, Rubert eventually discovered the Anti-Organic Equation.[1] This equation could be infiltrate minds of beings without noticeable effects. However, when activated in inorganic beings, it corrupts their consciousness, aligning them with the emperor's goal of exterminating all organic life in the universe.[11]\nAfter this, for unknown reasons, Rubert fell into a slumber. Aha the Elation and Mythus the Enigmata watched on as the Machine Empire crumbled in its absence. However, Rubert was eventually awakened by a group of organic beings walking on the Trailblaze while they were traversing into the Mechanical City. As it rose from slumber, the inorganic lives implanted with the Anti-Organic Equation was activitated, forcing them to instinctively kill any organic beings.[12]\nThe equation was later discovered in some organic beings plundering resources from other planets by the Technology Division of the IPC, leading them to conclude that the equation did not follow thoughts, but altered them.[11] It's able to make inorganic beings question their humanity and convince organics that they were machines. Later, Korapao and his subordinates in the Cargo Division attempted to decipher the logic behind the equation, succeeding to synthesize a replica of it. He ordered his organic subordinates to have the replica implanted into their minds to avail the benefits of inorganic lives.[5] The sheer complexity of this equation attracted the gaze of Nous, and Rubert was sent an invitation to the Genius Society by the Aeon, becoming its 27th member. This fulfilled the second moment as calculated by the Erudition.[6]\nAccording to Rubert's equation, the Philosopher Union that controlled the Laurel Wreath Galaxy was certain to be destroyed by the Machine Empire. The the inorganic lives within the Union fell under the influence of the Anti-Organic Equation was driven to exterminate all organic beings around them, erupting a civil war between inorganic and organic lifeforms in the Galaxy.[13] The inorganic lifeforms imprisoned the leader of the Union, Aurelius, in the Union's meeting place, then executed him in the name of Rubert and the Machine Empire by the means of lethal poisoning as humiliation for being the sole representative and leader of all living beings in the galaxy.[14] Left without a leader, the organic lives was soon defeated and the Union was reduced it to the domain of inorganic life.[15] The countless number of scholars died in this event led the IPC to deem this occurrence \"Rationality's Fall\".[13]\nFollowers of Elation started a riot after the fall of the Union, infecting Rubert's computer system with a troll virus called the \"Philosopher's Poison\" and overthrowing the local robot army.[15] Later, the Stellaron Hunters disseminated the virus across all of the Golcondar's colonies to take their Stellaron, causing millions of inorganic entities to turn into rampant machines.[16]\nIn Year 3287 Star Calendar, the Aurumatons unleashed a slaughter against the Xianzhou Alliance under the influence of Rubert, following the Civil War of the Xianzhou Yuanqiao. The coarse and the venerable reached an agreement and united forces to fight the Aurumatons' rebellion. In 3290, Zhige, the master primus of the aurumaton, led a force aboard the Xianzhou Yaoqing. Their combined forces launched an offensive operation, shattering the Aurumatons into pieces. All of the remaining aurumatons were herded into the arsenal and suppressed by talismans, stripping them of self-awareness. Those disassembled while retaining the ability to think had all records of the era eradicated from their Jade Abacus to make sure they pose no further threat in the future.[17][18]\nOut of belief that Nous' calculations are absolute, Genius Society member #4 Polka Kakamond took it upon to carry out the final moment of THEIR calculation.[19] From the onset of the war, she already began to conspire in Rubert's death. At the invitation of the IPC, she interrogated mechanical overlord Ludia Perthesius of the Machine Empire, seeking whereabouts regarding Rubert.[20] Although she made numerous attempts on Rubert's life before, none came to avail.[19] Only after the war had raged on for several Amber Eras did the moment Nous had foreseen arrive and allow her to succeeded.[21]\nDespite the efforts made by HooH the Equilibrium and Mythus the Enigmata to challenge Nous' calculations and alter its fate, all that changed was the angle at which Polka's scalpel pierced Rubert's chest. As the third moment occurred, Emperor Rubert I's gargantuan body collapsed along with its empire. Its death marked the end of the First Mechanical Emperor's War and fulfilled the Finality's predictions.[22]\nIn the aftermath of the war, rumors spread that Rubert was either taken out by Polka Kakamond or an assassin hired by the Interastral Peace Corporation,[1] but both may have been true. It was later revealed that the co-founder of the Corporation Dongfang Qixing had associated himself with Polka Kakamond, leveraging her political influence and keeping the war in control with omens, possibly relating to the Finality.[23]\nMany years following the death of Rubert I and the end of the First Emperor's War, a human visited its grave and solved the Anti-Organic Equation during his stay. Despite successfully deriving the solution thousands of times, he refused to speak of its answer, well aware of the consequences should the equation be activated. As a result, his achievement was met with doubt and he remained just as impoverish as before he set off. Soon after his return, he found himself plagued by increasingly negative thoughts, which not only affected his mind but also manifest physically in his limbs and torso. Suddenly, it occurred to him that all organic lives were machines made for deceptive purposes, while he was the only being with free will. In a morose declaration, he resolved that he would carry on Rubert I's will to eradicate all organic lives from the cosmos.[24]\nAlthough it's likely that this man was Rubert II, who professed to have inherited the memories of Rubert I and initiated the second Emperor's War,[25] Ruan Mei claimed that it's impossible for Rubert II to exist during the First Emperor's War, as it occurred far too long ago.[6] Not much is known of the Second Emperor's War onwards.\nDuring the first war, the inhabitants of Adlivun were left devastated by the Machine Empire before it entered in another struggle with the remnants of The Swarm. The destruction brought by both conflicts led to the ascension of Nanook as an Aeon.[26] Many antiques of high value were also destroyed, such as the Last Phonograph of Order created by Beyond the Sky Choir.[27]\nAfter the Second Rubert Rebellion, the IPC invested vast amounts of credits to repeatedly investigate the remains of Rubert II. To their surprise, Rubert II was found to be an organic being.[25]\nThe comparable damage inflicted by these two wars to that of the Swarm Disaster prompted the IPC to consider the extermination of all mechanical life forms across the cosmos. However, before the plan was passed, the they heard that Screwllum, a mechanical life-form, was selected by Nous to join the Genius Society as member #76. They gifted Screwllum the Mechanical Cuckoo Clock as a symbol of peace.[2]\nScrewllum actively opposes Rubert, and continues to do so today.[28]\n"

        "content": "Yaoshi (Chinese: 药师 Yàoshī) is an Aeon in Honkai: Star Rail representing the Path of Abundance.\nYaoshi's benevolent nature led THEM to grant THEIR blessing upon anyone who seeks immortality. However, the consequences of these blessings often result in a fate worse than death.[4]\nYaoshi is described as a figure with six arms and very pale skin, along with hair similar to that of a magpie’s feather in the Simulated Universe. THEY have antlers resembling branches sprouting from THEIR head and slits of red eyes with black sclera on parts of THEIR body.\nYaoshi is described wielding a staff in Foxian culture.[2]\nThe Aeon of Abundance did not exist at the time of the Swarm Disaster.[5]\nThe Xianzhou Alliance, originally a fleet of nine ships, embarked on a voyage to seek out Yaoshi for immortality. After finding Yaoshi, the Xianzhou Luofu was gifted with the Ambrosial Arbor, a giant tree that took root on the ship. The ancestors of the Luofu people ate its fruits and became a long-life species. However, this came with a heavy price: what followed was population expansion and diminishing resources. Other beings attacked the Xianzhou to take their sacred artifact, and countless atrocities were commited. Those who survived the war realized they were susceptible to mara, a condition long-life species suffer, turning them into \"beasts.\" They began to resent the gift given to them by Yaoshi. Other plaguemarks include the Lunar Embryo on the Yaoqing, the Primordial Flame on the Zhuming, the Miniature Myriads on the Fanghu, and the Fallow Earth on the Yuque. Five High Elders of the Vidyadhara descended to keep watch over the plaguemarks.[6][7][8]\nThe Disciples of Sanctus Medicus continued to worship Yaoshi as other Aeons like Qlipoth the Preservation, known as the Firmamend Arbiter among the Xianzhou, and Lan the Hunt, became ascendant in the Xianzhou Alliance. Although sharing the same name, the Disciples consist of two distinct groups. The first group, known as the Old Disciples of Sanctus Medicus to differentiate them from the more recent group, believed that the Denizens of Abundance deviated from Yaoshi's will and the mara-struck only existed because Yaoshi's will was improperly executed. The Old Disciples were not a notorious group for a long time and accepted skepticism with an open mind. They built apothecaries to help the poor and needy. They were treated with pity by those who had long abandoned their belief in Yaoshi, but were not particularly detested. They existed in secret for thousands of years and eventually became the Cold Springs sect, which overhauled the entire Xianzhou healthcare system.[9]\nAfter the Three Sufferings era, the Xianzhou completely banned belief in Yaoshi. The more recent group of Disciples, considered criminals in the Xianzhou, is less than 30 years old and arose in the wake of the Third Abundance War. Some blamed the Alliance and the Hunt for the suffering they endured. They used the same name as the old group, gathered around a \"master primus\", and claimed to have inherited the knowledge and legacy of the Theophany Era. They sought to lead the Xianzhou into the embrace of Yaoshi. In response, the Cold Springs sect published a statement clarifying that they no longer believed in Yaoshi.[9][10]\nThe Foxians and Borisin share a common ancestor. Foxian epics tell how the races were divinely inspired by a Lord of Longevity from beyond the stars. Drinking from the Redspring, they were granted immortality. But later historical developments saw the borisin consider the Foxians as slaves or cannon fodder, fueling their desire to conquer the stars.[11]\nBoth the foxians and borisins came from Verdantia, the \"Planet of Verdant.\" The foxians inhabited the riverlands while the borisins were herders who inhabited the grasslands. The foxians saw the borisins as savage, while the borisins saw the foxians as deceptive merchants. Despite their animosity, they cooperated with each other during the extreme climates of the \"Vulpesummer\" and \"Lupuswinter\" seasons. In the summer, they would set down their weapons for the rich harvests, but during the winter there would be unceasing conflict due to hunger.[12]\nOne Lupuswinter lasted far longer than usual, causing mass starvation. A prophet saw the end of the world and made a wish to Yaoshi for sustenance. This person is known as Lady Tushan in foxian legends, while the borisins believe it was a man named Duran. Yaoshi split the mountains and the divine nectar of the Redspring poured forth. Those who drank from the Redspring gained vitality and strength from the meat of beasts they ate, and their bodies became increasingly bestial. The Redspring transformed the the Planet of Verdant, which experienced a population explosion and ecological collapse. The canine races prayed to Yaoshi for help but THEY did not respond. As a result, the borisins and foxians both left for space. The borisins became spacefaring conquerors who brought the \"Lupuswinter\" to other planets.[12]\nAccording to  Foxian Drum Chanting Lament of the Six Follies, the Foxians came from the Old Verdant Home, another name for Verdantia. Their home world was ravaged by the borisin and they sought the help of gods to stop the borisin's rampage. Among the Foxians who fled from war, there were six brothers who fell into particularly dire straits. Their lamentations shook the mountains and sea, echoing into the skies. The Master of Immortality descended and asked them why they were wailing. The eldest brother cried because he feared the borisin's blades. The second brother sobbed due to the pain of disease. The third brother lamented out of cowardice and fear. The fourth brother was weak and powerless. The fifth brother witnessed the slaughter of family and friends and the enslavement of the living. The sixth brother longed for peace. The Master of Immortality granted gifts to each brother: to the eldest brother regeneration, the second brother freedom from disease, the third brother endless courage, the fourth brother wings on his back, the fifth brother freedom from all concerns. Only the sixth brother was given nothing.[2]\nThe five brothers bestowed with powers drove back the borisin, but their powers came with a price. The eldest brother's wounds festered and rotted, the second brother spread disease to his kin, the third brother's mind was twisted with hate, the fourth brother grew feathers all over his body, and the fifth brother lost all consciousness. Only the sixth brother was untouched, but as he raided the borisin bands seeking death, the borisin Warhead showed him a reflection of his image in the mirror. Only then did the sixth brother realize he had transformed into a canine beast like the borisin.[2]\nAccording to  Borisin Folk Song Collection, their first Warhead, Duran, obtained immortality from the dew of a tree guarded by Foxians tasked by Yaoshi to protect it. The song claims that Yaoshi only blessed the strong and used the Foxians as a test. After Duran and the beast, Taowu, slaughtered the Foxians, Duran asked Yaoshi to bless the borisin with immortality. However, this narrative is a fictional myth created by the borisin to justify their enslavement of the Foxians and to solidify their racial identity through their worship. Yaoshi does not bless only the strong and it is evident that the borisin interpret \"Abundance\" based on their own cultural norms and values. Based on the level of borisin civilization at the time of their unexpected rise, it is implausible that they initiated contact with Yaoshi, who probably bestowed THEIR gifts indiscriminately.[13]\nYaoshi has the power to grant mortals the blessing of long-life. THEY bestowed the Ambrosial Arbor on the Xianzhou Luofu, turning the Xianzhou natives into a long-life species.[8] Foxian epics tell how the races were divinely inspired by a Lord of Longevity from beyond the stars. Drinking from the Redspring, they were granted immortality.[11] The Warhead Duran obtained immortality from the Lunar Embryo, and the rest of the borisin obtained immortality after Duran requested it from Yaoshi, who let the Redspring's dew fall on the land.[13]\nThe degree of immortality differs according to each race and individual. Foxians have a lifespan of 250–450 years with a median age of death at 307.[14] Xianzhou Natives have an average lifespan of 800 years before succumbing to mara.[15][16] Foxians, Xianzhou Natives, and borisins all have enhanced regenerative healing capabilities, with the borisin being the greatest among them.[11] The heliobus species, an Abundance energy lifeform, is so imperishable that trapping them and using them as an energy source is considered the best way to deal with them.[17] Abundance healing is not restricted to organic matter. Luocha showed the ability to heal Xueyi's body, a mechanical ingenium puppet, through the power of the Abundance.[18]\nCertain individuals such as the first Xianzhou immortal \"Primus Immortus\" and the Abundance Emanator Shuhu may be functionally immortal and unkillable. The first Xianzhou immortal is still alive and imprisoned in the Shackling Prison, while Shuhu may have been killed in an attack on the Xianzhou, but according to the  Ten-Lords Commission Criminal Directory, there is a box which may contain Shuhu, also confined in the Shackling Prison.[19] Shuhu's flesh was used by Yingxing to aid Dan Feng in resurrecting their deceased friend, Baiheng. The process failed, and Yingxing gained healing properties so strong that he has come back from death hundreds of times ever since.[20] The borisin warhead Hoolay is also considered unkillable, unlike other borisin, due to the Crimson Moon, a product of the Lunar Embryo.[21][22] Another entity, the Void Existence, was able to gain immortality by consuming the blood of 3,120 Xianzhou residents.[19]\nYaoshi is closely connected to the phenomenon known as mara, something specially prevalent to Long-life species who have obtained their immortality from Yaoshi. The condition transforms individuals' bodies and robs them of their sanity.[23] According to records in the Cloud Knights Marital Doctrine, those who come into contact with Yaoshi can become struck with mara instantly.[24] Even trying to divine the fate of Yaoshi will cause the diviner to become mara-struck.[25]\nWhen Yaoshi appears in the Simulated Universe, the following sound will play: ▶\n...There is a lot of debate in the Guild about whether Yaoshi is good or evil, and I think that's just people having too much time on their hands. Anyone with the slightest respect for the universe wouldn't apply our narrow definitions of good and evil to incomprehensible existences such as Aeons. Personally, I have an open mind when it comes to Yaoshi — I will help the Xianzhou Alliance to sort out the Abominations of Abundance, but it won't stop me from genuinely admiring Yaoshi as a lonely and romantic existence. THEY travel between the universe with The Hunt and the Alliance in hot pursuit, both of which have sworn to destroy THEM... And yet THEY continue to bring enlightenment to world after world. I understand that the Abundance had never taken a single life, even though those THEY come into contact with often end up with a fate worse than death...\n...Does Yaoshi the Abundance actually understand THEIR actions and consequences? People across the universe hold polarized views on this. One party thinks Yaoshi does know of the consequences but does not care. Another party believes Yaoshi is tightly constrained by THEIR Path and cannot receive information outside of the Path. I gave some serious thought to this question when I wrote the chapter on Abundance in my book How I Joined the Genius Society, and my final conclusion was \"I don't know.\" Ahhh — We know so little about Aeons! I wouldn't have placed so much hope on the Simulated Universe otherwise ! [sic] Apparently, Yaoshi had spoken to the Denizens of Abundance and THEIR pursuer Xianzhou, and I hope the simulated Yaoshi would be willing to speak a few words to (Trailblazer) as well...\n"

The massacre was so frenzied that even the Annihilation Gang joined the hunt. However, Wyland eventually ran out of whale extract and died from graft-host rejection. According to statistics from the Intelligentsia Guild, there haven't been any living void song whales in that sector for a long time.[4]\nWhen Yukong was young, her parents took her on a starskiff to see void song whales.

They found a new home in the remains of the ship. As Insumousu's civilization developed, the ship grew to be considered a celestial palace and its deceased inhabitants were revered as fallen gods for many generations.[4] The fall of the Xianzhou Daiyu became known as the Divine Fall, and later became a holiday celebrated on the second day of rest in the Month of Tides — Divine Fall Day.[3]\nAs centuries passed, the Xianzhou Alliance eventually established contact with Insumousu and began trade and diplomatic relations with them.[4] After the people of Insumousu learned the truth behind the Divine Fall, they no longer had a religious view on the Daiyu and its people, though their sense of reverence would still remain. With the support of the Xianzhou Luofu's Celestial Guild, a new ritual was added to the Divine Fall Day celebration: people dive into the wreckage of the Xianzhou Daiyu to search for the remains of Xianzhou humans, then inter them into starskiffs and launch the skiffs into the star of the Thalassa system. The starskiffs are each inscribed with a row of beautiful Insumousu calligraphy that reads, \"You should undo the ropes for drowned sailors. Don't cry.

After receiving an abundance of nutrients, their cells divide, producing more offspring.[4]\nThe viscorpus is described as a peculiar creature with a gelatinous texture, with the ability to change its body shape freely to develop organs that can be used as weapons. They can grow eyes on different parts of their body, locking them in place, and mimicking the body structures of other species. Being able to traverse in space with its bare body, it is fittingly called a cosmic epidemic.[5]\nThe viscorpi are edible, and one dish made from them is viscorpus sugar balls stir-fried with cured meat.[6] Dehydrated viscorpus can also be used for medicinal purposes.[7]\nThe earliest record of the viscorpus can be traced back to the Lone Voyage Era, when the Xianzhou were wandering around in space. The populations of the Xianzhou Daiyu and Xianzhou Yuanqiao once declined drastically due to corrosion of viscorpuses.[1] In 1200 Star Calendar, the Daiyu exploded during the campaign against the viscorpuses.[8]\nAmid a war against the borisin, the alliance discovered that viscorpuses were once a kind of livestock grown and controlled by the borisin.

        "content": "Thalassa is an ocean planet with several islands.[2] Among the varying species of fish, there is a lightfish and a giant airborne creature called a six-eyed flying fish. The latter is large enough for an average humanoid to stand on and possibly be swallowed whole by. Aside from fish, there is also a species of dung beetle and a creature known as a Titanium Terrapin.[3][4]\nRock salt crystals from Insumousu can be used in Stone Calf Cimicifugae Infusion medicine on the Xianzhou.[5] Mineshroom is a type of fungi that exists only at the bottom of Khalnoss' oceans, and harvesting it can be quite dangerous as mishandling may lead to explosions. It tastes good and is extremely nutritious, while its blast radius can reach two meters, making it a high quality food item and an extremely potent weapon.[6] The Thalassan green coconut is also edible.[7]\nAn intelligent amphibious aquatic humanoid race with smooth skin, lungs and gills inhabit the planet and it is said a crystal palace lies at the bottom of Thalassa's ocean.[8][9] As the water dwellers grow out of their adolescent years, their lungs would gradually shrink, their necks metamorphose into gills, and their hands, feet, and eyes become more suited for underwater life. The poets always say, \"The people of Insumousu give their noisy and boisterous youth to the land, and their quiet and solemn old age to the ocean.\"[10]\nInsumousu is an Autonomous Region of Thalassa. The Xianzhou Daiyu had crashed here, heavily impacting the underwater landscape and inspiring the civilization of Insumousu, becoming known as a crystal palace or celestial palace at the bottom of the ocean and the deceased Xianzhou people known as fallen gods. [11] A great tide known to the Thalassans as the \"Devil's Tide,\" caused by the gravitational influence of their moon, occurs occasionally.[12]\nIn the days of old, the people of Insumousu had no knowledge of metallurgy nor had they yet invented written language. Thus, they turned to imagination to supplement their knowledge, and sought to understand all through the telling of stories. \"Legends\" were born as stories passed through the generations, turning into \"myths\" over time. \"Myths\" then shaped cognition as they themselves endured the flow of time, until \"civilization\" was born.[11] Back during the Iron Age, when civilization had barely begun, the people of Insumousu constructed magnificent buildings on the sea floor. Right in the middle of them was a huge statue, rising up out of the sea and stretching into the sky. The Insumousu locals were excited whenever they mentioned that great ruin, mentioning how it was a totem for their civilization, one that recorded the noble histories of their great people. At the time Lianyan visited, the ruins were four hundred years old. According to her, they are exquisite and truly magnificent.[13]\nInsumousu's land cities are usually full of young people, prone to staying up all night singing and dancing during Divine Fall Day. Foreign visitors, especially Xianzhou tourists, often choose to join in the festivities. Foreigners frequently fall in love with the vibrant atmosphere of the cities, these places said to be filled with fiery passion as unstoppable as tsunamis.[10] In accordance with the calendar of Insumousu, the second day of rest in the Month of Tides is Divine Fall Day — when the water dwellers recite scriptures, consume herbs, and perform bizarre dances along the current in honor of the fallen \"gods\" who brought a blessing to Insumousu. In modern times, Divine Fall Day gradually lost its original religious meaning — songs replace scriptures, delicacies replace herbs, and only the peculiar dances remain to this day as a cultural heritage. As the people of Insumousu became enlightened by civilization, they no longer see the broken ship's deceased crew as fallen gods. However, their reverence remained unchanged.[10]\nInsumousu's poets thus sing: \"The ocean may swallow mortals, yet their spirits live on forevermore.\" With the support of Xianzhou's Celestial Guild, a new ritual was added to the Divine Fall Day celebration: people would dive into the wreckage of the Xianzhou Daiyu to search for the remains of Xianzhou humans, then inter them into starskiffs and launch the skiffs into the star of the Thalassa system. The starskiffs are each inscribed with a row of beautiful Insumousu calligraphy that reads, \"You should undo the ropes for drowned sailors. Don't cry. You can sail safely after my demise.\"[11]\nThe well-educated Insumousu gentry always regarded themselves as a continuation of the Daiyu. \"What the Daiyu once followed, we should follow. What the Daiyu once fought against, we should also fight.\" When they tell stories from the past, they would still begin with these words: \"Once upon a time, the palace of the gods fell from the heavens.\"[11]\nInsumousu has a Water Dwellers Fisheries Association.[14]\nAround the Year 1200 Star Calendar, during the campaign against the Viscorpus, the Xianzhou Daiyu was irreparably damaged and breaking apart. Qingzhu, leader of the Daiyu, made the courageous decision to sacrifice herself and the entire ship to end the curse of the immortality plague.[11] The ship exploded and the fallen Xianzhou Daiyu crashed onto the surface of Thalassa, leaving a deep watery crater in the heart of the Insumousu sea.[15] It was said for seven planetary days, the world trembled. Amidst the chaos, some dispersed and fled in all directions. Others remained in the villages on land and under the sea, anticipating the descent of the vessel. This event became known as the Divine Fall and was celebrated as Divine Fall Day.[10]\nThe survivors of Insumousu, living in their abodes in the sea bed, witnessed how their beloved homes were shattered by the Xianzhou ship. Yet, with joy and elation, they soon found a new home in the remnants of the Daiyu after the Divine Fall, which was referred to as a celestial palace from beyond. As living conditions improved, the people of Insumousu had more time and energy to think, and started questioning the identity and origin of the Daiyu and it's deceased inhabitants. As centuries passed, Thalassa became a trade partner of the Xianzhou Alliance. It was then that the aquatic people of Insumousu set foot inside the \"celestial palace\" for the first time. There, they beheld the complete grandeur of the Xianzhou, and at last learned the truth behind the Divine Fall.[11]\nIn the past few hundred Star Calendar years, Insumousu had been generous in sharing its unique culture with the outside world, and the form of Divine Fall Day had quietly undergone more changes. Through their discovery of the history of the Daiyu, the people of Insumousu also learned of the tragedy behind its fall. The new ritual of diving for the Xianzhou people's remains and interring them on starskiffs was added to the Divine Fall Day celebrations. With this, the Xianzhou Alliance hoped that the fallen heroes will receive a dignified soul-soothing ceremony and the people of Insumousu, who were spared from the disaster, had given their response.[10]\nAt some point in history, Thalassa was invaded by borisin, who were driven out by the High-Cloud Quintet of the Xianzhou Alliance. They were listed amongst the Alliance's allied worlds and became considered a Xianzhou tourist resort.[16][13] Another unnamed conflict occured on Thalassa, where the Xianzhou Yuque's Echojade Fleet laid out a defense in coordination with the Xianzhou Yaoqing's encirclement and eradication of abominations. The Yuque's Master Diviner Jingtian determined the outcome of the battle and relayed it to the Generals, who in turn deployed Heroncrest Fleet of the Yaoqing instead of the Xianzhou Fanghu's Ebonpearl Fleet, as they were too far away. They pressed a strong offense for some time, but lost any hope of success thereafter due to the Devil Tide of Thalassa.[12]\nIn recent history, the Roaring Tide, an ambassador vessel from Thalassa, arrived onboard the Xianzhou Luofu carrying 60 cases of carnivorous tetras onboard its cargo, and was involved in an undescribed incident that led to 12 locals being injured.[17]During Yunli's lifetime, Thanjar of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus came into possession of the sword \"Crimson Thorn\" through unknown means. After the Zhuming's Cloud Knights tracked Thanjar's whereabouts to Insumousu, Yunli followed him and engaged in guerilla combat against him and his hired assassins over the course of a month. She managed to kill all his guards and pin Thanjar himself with her sword. Yunli then patiently waited for his lifeforce to run out, as the \"Crimson Thorn\" cannot keep him alive forever. Once Thanjar finally died, Yunli shattered the \"Crimson Thorn\", unintentionally draining some of her own lifeforce in the process. She rested for another month in Thalassa before returning to the Zhuming.[18]\n\n\n"

        "content": "Lan (Chinese: 岚 Lán), also known as the Reignbow Arbiter (Chinese: 帝弓司命 Dìgōng Sīmìng) or god of the Skybow (Chinese: 天弓 Tiāngōng), is an Aeon in Honkai: Star Rail representing The Hunt.\nLan harbors an intense hatred towards Yaoshi the Abundance and the undead abominations created by THEM. THEY tirelessly hunt them down, driven by the devastation the Abundance caused on THEIR homeworld.[4]\nIn contrast with the other Aeons, Lan pays close attention to mortals.[5] THEY often appear before them, but move too fast to be seen, the only portents of THEIR presence being vestiges of the Lux Arrow tearing across the sky. THEIR first appearance was around Year 3400 of the Star Calendar with THEIR Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow severing the Abundance's Ambrosial Arbor.\nLan is described as a tall, valiant prince with a crown in the Simulated Universe. THEY possess centaur like features, taking form of a man combined with an equine below the waist, while the hind legs are replaced by wheels of a chariot.\nA Xianzhou origin myth found in the \"Ode to Reignbow Path\" describes the pre-ascended Reignbow Arbiter as an anonymous Xianzhou hero. This is believed to be historical truth by a minority of academics. However, there is no factual evidence to show that the hero is Lan. Although the Xianzhou Alliance has never outright denied the myth's authenticity, their unclear stance on the subject has been taken as an implicit denial.[6][7]\nThe Reignbow Arbiter was originally not a god, but a mortal born before the Three Sufferings era. Based on historical records, they were born in approximately 1700 Star Calendar.[8]\nAt some point in the past, they led the Xianzhou army against the Heliobi, who formed a red micro-star to capture the Xianzhou fleet. A suicide squad led by the Reignbow disassembled and weaponized the auxiliary engine of the Xianzhou Yaoqing, and sent straight into the the red star, causing the star to undergo early decay and implode into a black hole. After their victory, the Xianzhou army locked up the defeated Heliobi leader, the Flint Emperor, sentencing them to serve as the power source for the Xianzhou Zhuming for the rest of their eternal life.[8]\nThe planting of the Ambrosial Arbor on the Xianzhou Luofu brought celebration and joy for the immortality it promised. However, the Reignbow foresaw the devastation that mara would cause to the Xianzhou, possibly with the help of the Wisdomwalker. When they tried to warn the others of this future, they were mocked and labeled as insane. To show their resolve, they shot the Ambrosial Arbor — an act they would be convicted for. The aristocrats who had eaten the fruit of the Arbor were enraged, but as they still respected the Reignbow's heroic exploits and prestige, could only sentence them to continual hibernation in cryo-sleep pods.[8]\nDuring the \"Flaming Catastrophe,\" one of the Three Sufferings of the Era of Bloodshed, the Xianzhou Alliance encountered the tree-planet Muldrasil, which gravitated towards the Luofu's Arbor. War broke out between the Xianzhou and Muldrasil. Fatigued from their civil war between the coarse and the nobility, as well as the aurumaton rebellion, the Xianzhou decided to release all prisoners of the cryo-hibernation from their slumber to help them fight. Among the released prisoners was the Reignbow. Once awakened, they descended into the prison deep within the Zhuming and made a deal with the Flint Emperor, allowing them to possess their physical body in exchange for the power of Heliobi.[8]\nInspired by the Reignbow’s sacrifice, many Xianzhou residents made the same deal with heliobi and formed suicide squads to fight in the war against Muldrasil. The Reignbow took position from the bow of the Yaoqing and shot an arrow enhanced by the power of the Flint Emperor.[9] The force of their star-shattering shot was so great that it affected every ship of the Xianzhou Alliance, as \"blood rain poured upon the Xuling\" and \"nights turned crimson on the Fanghu.\" The arrow smashed into the Ambrosial Arbor and severed its connection to Muldrasil, greatly wounding the planet. This ripped open a fissure into the void and a monstrous wave of imaginary force spewed from it.[8]\nBased on historical records, the Reignbow disappeared after shooting that arrow, although the Flint Emperor had left behind part of their body.[8] It is believed that the Reignbow saved the battle at the cost of \"self-burning,\" and they ascended to Aeonhood after their death.[9]\nIn Year 3400, the Reignbow Arbiter appeared for the first time and severed the Ambrosial Arbor with THEIR Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow, saving the Xianzhou Luofu from the Muldrasil and the wingweavers.[1][7]\nIn Year 4100, the Reignbow Arbiter became the undisputed main Aeon of the Xianzhou Alliance, displacing the Xianzhou's previous worship of Qlipoth.[10]\nIn Year 7900, the Yuque's Cloudpeer Telescope managed to detect Reignbow's manifestation. Trace elements pointed to three coordinates in the Consternation Starzone: The Yadav variable star; the Cerulean Nightmare; and the Knucklebone. Using the Matrix of Prescience, the master diviner predicted that it must have been plagued.[11]\nIn Year 7954, the Cloudpeer Telescope managed to detect traces of Reignbow's Lux Arrow nearby Laevateinn-XVI. When the Cloud Knights' Vernalbolt Fleet arrived at the coordinates, the planet had been destroyed without any survivors remaining. It was categorized as a \"deadworld,\" and deleted from the astral charts.[11]\nIn Year 8072, during the Third Abundance War, Fu Xuan came up with a plan to ship the Cloudpeer Telescope to the Xianzhou Fanghu, which had fallen victim to a surprise attack from the Denizens of Abundance. Jingtian, former Master Diviner of the Yuque's Divination Commission and the only person who had the permission to use the telescope, sent out an SOS signal to the last observed location of the Reignbow's Lux Arrow.[12] Yueyu, former Arbiter-General of the Yaoqing, defended the telescope till her last moment.[13] The Reignbow descended onto the battlefield and fired THEIR Lux Arrow, annihilating the borisins' fleet and turning the tide of the battle. However, the supreme destructive force of THEIR divine arrow destroyed nearly one-fifth of the Xianzhou Fanghu's delves.[11] Within these delves was the field hospital Yufei, an Alchemy Commission healer, was stationed at.[14]\nIn AE 2131, the astronomical observation system detected a spacial disturbance left by an entity traveling too fast to be measured. Shortly thereafter, a flash of light cleaved apart the sky, leaving behind abnormal rainbow-colored traces. Half a unit of system time later, the entirety of the planet Xuange imploded. Xuange's inhabitants were affected by the molting disease and the planet's destruction was attributed to the Hunt.[15]\nAt some point of AE 2158 (Star Calendar Year 8100[16]) during the Luminary Wardance Ceremony on the Luofu, when Feixiao confronted Hoolay in Inner Beast's Battlefield, they debated on the reason they fight knowing that Aeons never answer the mortals. She answered that she fights so that one day she will never have to witness another Lux Arrow falling to the ground and so that just one more person can live and return to the Yaoqing alongside her. She prayed that the arrows of The Hunt will pierce the heart of every monster even if Lan does not respond to her. As Lan witnessed her determination, THEY gazed at her and sent her axe to the battlefield like a shooting star.[17]\nThe Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow is a projectile weapon shot by Lan that can shatter stars light-years away. Shards of the Lux Arrow can be reforged by the Furnace Master, chief of the Xianzhou artisans, for those who are worthy.[18] At the end of the Third Denizens of Abundance War, the Reignbow Arbiter's Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow wiped out everything along the way. The Xianzhou people used the burning embers of the arrow to create many divine objects.[19] The Lux Arrow is the only known material that can harm the Ambrosial Arbor.[20] The arrows are made with stars and shot with gravity.[21]\nAlthough the Simulated Universe Index says that Lan often appears before mortals, Fu Xuan says that THEY rarely appear before mortals and \"the only portents of THEIR presence are vestiges of the Lux Arrow tearing across the sky.\"[1] The Record of Reignbow's Road says that \"Reignbow would never speak to any mortal... THEY only let their Lux Arrow do all the talking.\"[11] According to Welt, Lan does not rank among the more powerful Aeons as THEIR path is very narrow, but THEY pay close attention to mortals. THEY grant strength to the Xianzhou Alliance without reservation, allowing their marshal and six generals to stand on par with the Lord Ravagers, Emanators of Nanook the Destruction.[5]\nEach of the seven Arbiter-Generals possesses a Spiritus (Chinese: 威灵) granted to them by Lan.[22]\nThe Lightning-Lord (Chinese: 神君), full name Lightning-Wielding Thunder-Clapping Spirit-Squashing Lord (Chinese: 神霄雷府总司驱雷掣电追魔扫秽天君),[23] is the Spiritus granted by Lan to the Arbiter-General of the Luofu, and it is described as enveloped in golden lightning.[24] Currently Jing Yuan commands the Lightning-Lord and it was previously wielded by Teng Xiao.[25][26]\nFlying Aureus (Chinese: 飞黄) is the Spiritus bestowed upon the General of the Yaoqing, its speed is the greatest out of the seven spirits manifestated by Lan and it is used as the symbol of the Verdant Knights.[27][28] Currently Feixiao commands Flying Aureus and it was presumably previously wielded by Yueyu.[29]\nWhen Lan appears in the Simulated Universe, the following sound will play: ▶\n...Lan, on the other hand, often appears before mortals. However, THEY move too fast, and very few observations have been made about THEIR actual form. Most of the reliable information is kept by the Xianzhou Alliance and it took me a great amount of effort to get. As one of the rare factions in the universe that is completely blessed by an Aeon, the Alliance stands on equal grounds with the IPC, which meant the IPC couldn't help me at all. In the end, Ruan Mei had to step up to help. In the ancient Xianzhou language, \"Lan\" means \"an unpredictable fog,\" and the Aeon's formal name in Xianzhou is Reignbow Arbiter. According to Xianzhou natives, the Lux Arrow of The Hunt showed them the way as their civilization was about to fall...\n...How would you describe the Aeon of The Hunt? We can get an impression from the Xuange Observation Station's report in AE 2131. The astronomical observation system detected a gravitational wave, a spatial disturbance left by an entity traveling too fast to be measured and covering astronomical distances. Shortly thereafter, a flash of light cleaved apart the sky, leaving behind abnormal rainbow-colored traces. Half a unit of system time later, the entirety of the planet Xuange imploded. The bad news was the IPC lost a planet in its business sphere. The good news was the IPC was out of ideas regarding the molting disease (undoubtedly the work of Yaoshi) spreading throughout Xuange. The light permanently \"healed\" that planet and the patients on it, a race of immortal half-human half-snake monsters. This is the action and creed of The Hunt, for whom salvation and destruction are nigh indistinguishable. Their perpetual enemy, the Abundance, is the same, for THEY bring healing and torment hand-in-hand...\n"

        "content": "The heliobus,[Note 1] plural heliobi, also known as the Shapeless and Starfire Essence, is a shapeless species made of pure energy that appears as flames capable of cognizant speech.[1]\nHeliobi appear to be closely related to Wubbaboos, as the latter belongs to the Heliobus species of the Spirit Essence family and are categorized as Kingdom Spiritual Organisms, Class Astral Spirits, Order Shapeless.[2] They are also known as a type of energy lifeform.[3]\nThe planet they originate from is unknown.[4] On the Xianzhou Zhuming, heliobi slowly spawn from the Flint Emperor. The Flamehunt Judges of the Zhuming Ten-Lords Commission then capture these newborn heliobi before they come into contact with emotions and tame them with gentle dreams. These harmless heliobi are passed to the Artisanship Commission's Temperaflame Office, which matches the heliobi with various artifacts to make them into lamps, vehicles, weapons, and various spectacles on the Zhuming.[5]\nThe heliobi love to parasitize and control bodies, especially of sentient humanoid races. This is to experience the various changes of the nervous system triggered by emotions. This behavior of \"emotion consumption\" satiates them. The host will uncontrollably conduct stimulating behaviors — such as binge-eating, impulsiveness, self-mutilation, or destruction — to please the heliobi within them, in exchange for the heliobi's powerful abilities. They are also capable of making their hosts experience \"wild delusions.\" The process of heliobi taming the host's psyche is a process that expends the host's physical body without replenishment.[4]\nA heliobus disrupts a host's nervous system to communicate and exploit their vulnerabilities, causing hallucinations and intense emotions. Initially, the host perceives an additional presence within their mind, but over time, they struggle to distinguish between their own thoughts and those of the heliobus. Driven by the heliobus, the host increasingly acts on their deepest desires—whether through endless battles, excessive indulgence, or unrestrained lust—losing all self-control and morality. This descent into madness, similar to \"mara,\" ultimately leads to the host's body being drained and spontaneously combusting, often fatally.[6] Even without possession, people will deteriorate and die from exposure to heliobi who unconsciously consume their body.[7]\nHanguang, using the heliobi, created a total of 1,382 cursed swords, with 182 of these having unique designs. With these swords, the wielders were granted strength and valor, and could even have the weapon make decisions. Yet the heliobi infused within these weapon had absorbed anger, fear, and bloodlust, turning the wielders into bloodthirsty puppets, possessed by the sword.[8]\nHeliobi perceive the emotions of their hosts in a manner similar to how humans perceive flavors, such as \"delicious,\" \"sour,\" \"sweet,\" or \"bitter\". They possess the ability to easily discern the emotions experienced by their host. As such, they are drawn to individuals with intense desires, those who have undergone profound life experiences, and those harboring many unfulfilled wishes. Hosts possessing such properties are particularly enticing to heliobi due to the abundance of emotions and experiences they contain. However, it is worth noting that heliobi do not exhibit discernible preferences when selecting hosts, as evidenced by the distribution of victims in documented cases.[6]\nThey've displayed an aversion to possessing long-life species, considering the Xianzhou people as \"indigestible\" when interrogated. It can be inferred that the longevity and robust physical resilience of long-life species hinder heliobi's ability to subjugate their hosts' will.[6]\nIt has been at least six thousand years since the heliobi were subdued, making it virtually impossible to study their social organization.[4]\nThe people of the Zhuming are able to coexist with the heliobi without falling under their influence.[9]\nHeliobi appear to enjoy Phase Flame ash.[10]\nThough heliobi are recognized as an Abomination of Abundance, they rarely appeared as a part of the Denizens of Abundance's legions. On the contrary, they had once allied with Xianzhou, but only for a very short duration under specific circumstances.[4]\nWithout possessing a body, a heliobus generally looks like a greenish-blue ball of flame. \nWhen heliobi appear, electrical equipment will detect some sort of highly-intensive electromagnetic wave emission. As creatures of the Shapeless order, they can avoid the emission range of visible light and disappear from human sight. However, in situations when they need a host to notice them, they usually appear as a ball of heatless teal-colored \"fire.\"[4]\nLike how humans push physical objects, individual heliobi can also alter the energy balance of an area, freely converting energy from one type to another. By manipulating energy, they can create visual images, make fire or ice, and produce vibrations. This made heliobi appear as gods or demons to primitive civilizations.[4]\nBased on the size of an individual's \"fire,\" one can judge the strength of that heliobus and how much energy it can master.[4] Heliobi are able to merge together and combine their strength, as the heliobi which made up Ignamar once did in the fight against general Teng Xiao of the Luofu; however, when defeated, they scatter into fragments.[11]\nAs Starfire Essences, heliobi do not die, and the only permanent way to render them harmless is to trap them indefinitely.[11] There are means to completely eradicate a heliobus, with one effective method being to confine it within an intangible force field, isolating it from other beings. Alternatively, its power can be harnessed as an inexhaustible energy source using the Creation Furnace. The Ten-Lords Commission provides sacred vessels designed specifically for capturing heliobi.[6]\nOnce a heliobus comes into contact with a Stellaron, they feel a burning sensation.[11]\nAs an individual heliobus possesses more and more hosts over time, it also slowly develops a personality and becomes distinctly different from its kin. The Ten-Lords Commission surmised that this race learns from the hosts' brains through their parasitism.[4]\nWhen a heliobus possesses a human host, it adopts the personality and behavioral patterns of that host, leading to the development of a distinct individual awareness that hinders bonding and \"fusion\" with other heliobi.[6]\nAccording to ancient manuscripts, heliobi exhibit behaviors akin to swarms of bees. These fiery essences possess the ability to divide and merge, exchanging information and experiences with each other, and enhance their collective strength against adversaries.[6] This process is known as heliobic homogenization.[12]\nWhile heliobi that have merged together may still be perceived as individual entities, the conglomerate maintains internal hierarchies (reminiscent of ancient Xianzhou beliefs that attributed three souls and seven spirits within one humans). Within the cluster, certain heliobi specialize in combat, while others engage in contemplation and debate, and the most powerful oversees strategic coordination.[6]\nThey have a certain level of repulsion against advanced technical equipment, and have never developed any technology, due to the race's ability to manipulate energy.\nMost heliobi struggle to cooperate harmoniously with each other due to how they've been tainted by human nature. This weakness can be exploited by posing complex and thought-provoking questions to them, causing them to splinter from within. However, ancient records mention the existence of formidable individual heliobi, such as the Flint Emperor and Phantylia. These individuals possess unwavering self-awareness and, over time, are able to resolve their internal differences and form an indissoluble whole (the heliobi call this process \"fusion\"). Weaker heliobi harbor immense fear of getting close to these great elder beings, for once absorbed, it will equals to the death of the weaker heliobus.[6]\nThe Xianzhou first came to contact with the heliobi during the Lone Voyage Era, before the Xianzhou Natives turned into a long-life species. They appeared before the Xianzhou aristocrats, introducing themselves a shapeless and rootless race, beseeching Xianzhou to give them a safe berth. The species were adept at creating mirages and illusions to tempt humans. Thus, the people of Xianzhou became addicted to these wondrous creatures of pure energy and indulged in frolicking with them.[4]\nThe Heliobi soon exposed their true colors as the they tried to take humans' bodies, drain their emotions, and control their will. This was known as the Possession Tragedy, or the \"Occupation Tragedy,\" from which the Xianzhou Zhuming suffered the greatest. The Xianzhou artisans ultimately bound the heliobi within shapeless prisons and sentenced them to provide energy for Xianzhou for all eternity.[4]\nDuring the Heliobi Wars, the Heliobi formed a red micro-star in an attempt to capture the Xianzhou fleet. A suicide squad, led by an anonymous hero, believed to be Lan prior to their ascension to Aeonhood in certain myths, disassembled and weaponized the ship's auxiliary engines to fight them. The Xianzhou's suicide squad sent the weaponized auxiliary engine straight into the red star, causing it to undergo early decay and implode into a black hole. At the end, the Flint Emperor was imprisoned and sentenced to serve as the power source for the Xianzhou Zhuming for the rest of their eternal life.[13]\nThe Flint Emperor’s imprisonment lasted till the end of the second war against the wingweavers, when the hero broke the seal binding the rest of the heliobi, made an alliance with them, and relied on their power to defeat the army of Muldrasil. After that campaign, the heliobi were also severely diminished. The Flint Emperor was heavily wounded and left behind part of its body. Its leaders were once again imprisoned and sealed in the various Xianzhou ships' Shackling Prisons. There have been almost no traces of them found in the universe since, except on the Xianzhou Zhuming.[4][14]\nIt is rumored that the Creation Furnace in the Xianzhou Luofu is powered by an imprisoned heliobus.[15][4] In recent history, Master Gongshu of the Luofu Artisanship Commission had developed a weapon that utilizes heliobus energy called the Luminflux Pyxis.[16]\nPrior to Jing Yuan's promotion, the previous Luofu General, Teng Xiao, defeated a powerful heliobus known as Ignamar and sealed it away. Ignamar shattered into many smaller fragments of itself, after which they were all sealed in the Creation Furnace by the Ten-Lords Commission until it was damaged, setting the fragments free. Due to Ignamar's defeat, its fragments were unable to take on physical forms and wanted a rematch with the Luofu General. Most of these fragments would convene at Fyxestroll Garden.[11]\nOne of these fragments, Tail, refused to possess anyone and was on the brink of being extinguished when Huohuo came upon him, deciding to take the flame, resulting in Tail possessing her. Hanya, a judge of the Ten-Lords Commission, soon arrived and realized she could not expel him without hurting Huohuo, decided to seal him instead. \nDuring the Ambrosial Arbor Crisis, the Lord Ravager Phantylia, a heliobus, infiltrated the Luofu disguised as Tingyun with the purpose of destroying the Luofu from the inside-out. She gave the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus a Stellaron and told them that the Ambrosial Arbor would bestow upon them undying bodies once it was revived. After Dan Shu, the Master of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, was defeated by the Trailblazer, Phantylia discarded her disguise without leaving its remains behind and left in the form of a flame.[17]\nPhantylia headed to the roots of the Ambrosial Arbor and took control of its power and a body created by the Arbor. After the Trailblazers found her, a battle ensued where she tried to convert Jing Yuan into a member of the Antimatter Legion. In doing so, a mental link was formed between the two, allowing Dan Heng • Imbibitor Lunae to damage her by attacking Jing Yuan. After Phantylia was defeated, she taunted Jing Yuan before leaving.[18]\nAfter the Ambrosial Arbor crisis was resolved, the Trailblazer received a message from Guinaifen and arrived at Fyxestroll Garden. Cirrus attempted to collect fragments to cause trouble; the first time it was foiled by Tail, and the second time by Jing Yuan after he agreed to battle it upon defeating his \"army\". Cirrus would later be sealed in the Suppression Tower, Verdant Terrace, though it still vowed to battle the Luofu General again.[19]\n"

        "content": "While the Heliobi were wiped out toward the end of the Flaming Catastrophe, a small number of them could still be found on the Zhuming.[3] According to Qingzu, Zhuming residents love to play with fire, and it is said the Xianzhou Zhuming will continue to ally with fire, journey with fire, and share its destiny with that of the fire.[4][5]\nThe Zhuming is described to look different than a typical Xianzhou ship, like an intricately-carved filigree golden lotus, gradually unfolding its lustrous leaves around the cone-headed central hull. The giant glowing \"lotus leaves\" gradually spread out around the \"light poles\" and are bathed in a soft blue glow. At its center is a spherical cage encasing a blue sun. This structure is known as the Flamewheel Forge.[6] It was said that the craftsmen here were liberal in form and definition, and that the residents have completely transformed the ship beyond recognition since their departure several millennia ago.[7]\nXianzhou artifex technology is on the bleeding edge, with the Zhuming being among the most advanced of all. Just as Elixir Seekers rush to the Luofu in a neverending stream, so too is the Zhuming on par with Pier Point and Planet Screwllum for craft apprentices and production engineering technology. Countless Outworlders come to the Zhuming from all over the cosmos to study skills, and most return to their homelands afterward to disseminate those learnings, and countless craftsmen are busy melting metals and forging their masterpieces. \nApprentices from different worlds come together before the Forge and become fellow students, then compete and share their skills. Outworlders who come in search of marvelous tools also pay a hefty sum to commission artisans to craft otherworldly items — however, the countless apprentices over the millennia have rarely been favored by General Huaiyan, the \"Artisan of Artisans.\" Whenever he tutors students himself and personally passes on his skills both as a craftsman and a soldier, these students would either become grandmasters who leave a mark in the annals as Furnace Masters, or Cloud Knights with names that thunder through the Alliance such as the Flamewheel Octet.[6] The ship's blast furnaces are smoldering with flames, and various ingenia are constantly being transported on its deck.[8]\nSome sixty or seventy percent of all the Xianzhou's armory comes from the artisans of the Zhuming, and they don't lack for arms. As such, General Huaiyan was willing to allocate three hundred fighter jets, twenty thousand thunder crossbows, and twenty thousand devastator glaives to reinforce the Heroncrest Fleet, but only a dozen or so personnel.[7] They are known for their use of artillery in combat, and have weapons of mass destruction such as Zhuming Flames and Alchemical Arrows.[9][10] The Zhuming itself also possesses enormous cannons that are forged by the Disatta.[5]\nAccording to Hanya, the Zhuming is under the influence of the Reignbow Arbiter, and the people there are able to coexist with the heliobi while being free from their manipulation.[11] The Zhuming houses the Flint Emperor, the progenitor of the heliobi, within the Flamewheel Forge. Due to the Flint Emperor's power, the Zhuming is accompanied by multicolored light bands in space. \nOn the outermost skirts of these Flint Emperor's breaths, newborn heliobi slowly come into being. The Flamehunt Judges of the Zhuming Ten-Lords Commission then capture these heliobi before they come into contact with emotions and tame them with gentle dreams. These harmless heliobi are passed to the Artisanship Commission's Temperaflame Office where they are matched with various objects in the Zhuming, such as lamps and vehicles.[5]\nThe Zhuming is less conservative when it comes to heliobi compared to the Luofu. If a heliobus on the Zhuming is encountered that was capable and had no harmful intentions, it would definitely not be sealed up.[12]\nZhuming flower-drum opera is a type of performance art that is traditionally sung by two singers to produce that eeriness of being possessed by heliobi. \"Wedding Wine\" is the most famous of all the Zhuming flower-drum opera.[13]\nTuskpirs originate from the Xianzhou Zhuming and are often kept as pets due to their ability to feed on dreams and treat psychological concerns such as anxiety. A migratory beast, it lives in hot springs, valleys, and other places with geothermal heat.[14] Berrypheasants can also be found in the wilds of the Zhuming. Berrypheasants live in symbiosis with plants, with a lot of fruit hanging from their tails. During the Fire Taboo Festival, every household in the Xianzhou Alliance will pre-cook berrypheasant eggs, each shell intricately engraved with gorgeous patterning that symbolizes auspice. The Xianzhou people may have engraved these eggshells themselves in the past, but over the generations, people gradually began to buy up machine-engraved eggs instead. The Zhuming also has a species of wolfberries and pepper.[15][16]\nThe Flamewheel Forge is the foundational base of the Xianzhou Zhuming's Artisanship Commission and the most important location for the Zhuming's manufacturing industry. An unknown emperor of the Primeval Imperium was said to have once gifted the master craftsman of the Zhuming, Grand Artisan Yang Di, with a weapons-casting mold in honor of its maiden voyage. To this day it remains, passed down through the ages to be the pride of place in the palace. \"Smelt for a thousand stars; quicken with steel of heroes. The forge's light boosts power and might; and armaments guard both hearth and meal.\" These verses hang in adornment in the main hall of the Flamewheel Forge.\nInside the palace also contains the Flint Emperor, also known as the Primordial Flame or Pseudo Sun.[7] It is said that it is a living flame that slumbers in the engine of the Zhuming. It is a creature the Xianzhou regarded as a great enemy in the old days, also called the Primordial Flame. The craftsmen of the Zhuming used every means available to imprison it in the furnace and used its power to forge various divine weapons.[17] Therefore, the Flamewheel Forge came to be regarded as the holy pilgrimage site for such technologies in the entire Cosmos. The Zhuming uses the Flint Emperor as an inexhaustible power source.[5]\nThe Flamewheel Forge appears as a spherical cage the size of a celestial object containing a blue sun at the center of the Zhuming. The Flamewheel Forge has intricate branch-like track systems that cover the star as much as possible, and the delicate boughs and leaves are choked with receptors and transmitters that guide the Primordial Flame \"Flint Emperor\" to provide energy for all technological developments.\n[6]\nDeeper past the Forge is the hypergravity field created by the Pseudo Sun. Regular folk struggle to endure a stellar density of this degree. It is an inwardly collapsing disorder that only Disatta artisans can traverse with ease. The scorching stellar surges and abnormal celestial phenomena prevent the curious from continuing to approach the Pseudo Sun. All fundamental physical laws of the universe have been augmented to a terrifying degree in this space. \nOnly one stout and powerful stellar race, the Disatta, can survive in spaces with such gravitational abnormalities. The Disatta are natural-born elite artisans. They pass between the Forge and the Pseudo Sun, and their perception of time has long strayed from that of normal beings. They keep their promise and continue to improve their artisanship, keeping watch over the Pseudo Sun's slumber. The Xianzhou Zhuming regards Disatta as loyal allies, respecting their tenacity and strength, while being grateful for their selfless sacrifice.[5]\nThe Firmamend Temple was built by the IPC on the Zhuming during the Crisis of Belief, a 600 year time period between the Year 3400 to 4000 Star Calendar where Qlipoth was once the pillar of the Xianzhou Alliance's beliefs. The temple is now an affiliated academy of the Zhuming Artisanship Commission.[18] Achievements in Alchemy is an alchemy textbook used in the academy. The book compiled by the Zhuming Alchemy Commission is a comprehensive summary of alchemical prescriptions and their smelting and refinement techniques.[19]\nThe Zhuming's Alchemy Commission compiled the book Achievements in Alchemy [sic], a comprehensive summary of alchemical prescriptions and their smelting and refinement techniques. The book is used as a textbook in the academy.[19] Piercing Gaze sect of the Zhuming's Alchemy Commission uses specialist medical treatments such as acupuncture, aromatherapy, and pyropathy. Ardens Regia is a practitioner of this healing art.[20] It can be used to purge evil from the soldiers of the Dawn Army when the connection between a person and a heliobus becomes unstable.[21]\nThe vast starskiff platform was described as seemingly chiseled out of a single block of moonstone, so big that it disappears over the horizon with a comfortable, soothing honey-yellow color and the seamless integration of the structure's frame into the port — as if it's an array of metals sprouting from the minerals below. It is described as a proud and blatant display of craftsmanship sulpted deliberately to debunk any biased ideas Outworlders might have formed before they arrived on the Zhuming.[7]\nThe Zhuming is also home to the Dragon Palace's Kitchen, the only Interastral Gourmet Association-rated five star restaurant among all the Xianzhou ships.[22]\nDuring the Heliobi Wars, the Heliobi formed a red micro-star in an attempt to capture the Xianzhou fleet. A suicide squad, led by the Reignbow, disassembled and weaponized the ship's auxiliary engines to fight the Heliobi. The Xianzhou's suicide squad sent the weaponized auxiliary engine straight into the red star formed by the Heliobi, causing it to undergo early decay and implode into a black hole. The defeated Heliobi leader, the Flint Emperor, was imprisoned and sentenced to serve as the power source for the Xianzhou Zhuming for the rest of their eternal life.[23]\nIn the Theophany Era, in December, Year 2607 Star Calendar, the Xianzhou Zhuming, alongside the Yaoqing and Fanghu, introduced its own Yellowjacket Census and Almanacs, advising of all death revitalizations on Xianzhou for that year.[24] On February, Year 3198 Star Calendar, the Xianzhou fleet was embroiled in chaos due to coarse revolts on several ships. The coarse master messaged each ship and they launched an assault on the Xianzhou Zhuming, holing up in a delve with an expeditionary force to fight against the nobles.  Both sides eventually reached a ceasefire and join forces to defeat the rebelling aurumatons, dispatching envoys to negotiate peace with each other. A peace agreement is reached and military affairs are curtailed. Troops are reorganized to defeat the aurumatons, putting an end to the aurumaton rebellion.[25]\nDuring the Era of Bloodshed, the Xianzhou Alliance encountered the Dyson tree Muldrasil, homeland of the Wingweavers, feeding off nearby stars, and war broke out between them. Due to lack of manpower from earlier conflicts, the Xianzhou Alliance released their prisoners from cryo-hibernation to counter the invasion, including the previously imprisoned Reignbow. The Reignbow went into the prison deep within the Xianzhou Zhuming to persuade the the Flint Emperor to help them fight off the Denizens of Abundance. The two of them made a deal, and the Reignbow allowed the Flint Emperor to possess their physical body, in exchange for the power of the Heliobi. Inspired by the Reignbow's sacrifice, other Xianzhou residents made the same deal, forming suicide squads and marching alongside the Heliobi. During the battle, the Reignbow shot their Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow from the bow of the Yaoqing, using their famed bow \"Xuanyuan\", causing great casualties among even the furthest ships, the Xuling and Fanghu. After the battle, the Reignbow disappeared.[23] Between the Year 3400 to 4000 Star Calendar during the Crisis of Belief, the IPC built the Firmamend Temple on the Zhuming.[18]\nIn The Year 4800 of the Star Calendar, the five lineages of the Vidyadhara made alliance on the Yuque, putting their sacred vow into writing. \"This oath shall remain unbroken, standing stronger than even earth and steel.\" High Elder Ardens Regia was bound to watch over the Primordial Flame on the Zhuming.[26]\nAt some point in history, the Zhuming, alongside the Yaoqing and Fanghu, engaged in warfare against Lord Ravager Celenova and her troops.[27] In the Year 5700 Star Calendar, Celenova boarded a Xianzhou ship and requested a ceasefire with the Xianzhou Zhuming, requesting the ship to change course and assist in attacking the homeworld of the wingweavers.[28] In 7032 Star Calendar, 23-year-old Izumitamagawa arrived at the Xianzhou Zhuming as a trade specialist, and resided there as a visitor for the rest of her life. She realized that the galaxy's knowledge of the Xianzhou Alliance at the time was mostly based on incomplete stories or unfounded rumors. Therefore, she resolved to author an epic work that would comprehensively present the Xianzhou civilization to foreigners. That was how, forty years later, the Grand Encyclopedia of Xianzhou was born.[29]\nOnce, a delegation containing Baiheng and a dozen others were sent to request for arms and reinforcements from the Zhuming for the Yaoqing's Heroncrest Fleet, who were occupied with fighting the Borisin. They were recieved by General Huaiyan's apprentice, Yingxing, at Radiant Zenith and escorted through by the Flamewheel Forge, where they observed the Flint Emperor's light being sealed. There, they met with Huaiyan, who was willing to allocate three hundred fighter jets, twenty thousand thunder crossbows, and twenty thousand devastator glaives in response to Helm-Master Qingying's request for reinforcements, but only a dozen or so personnel.[7]\nAt some point, Hanguang was recognized as an exceptional swordsmith, described as the greatest master craftsman since Yingxing. Travelers from all over would visit the Flamewheel Forge to get one of his swords. He had an unusual passion for forging, and dreamed of forging a sword with self-awareness that would surpass humans. In order to create this kind of weapon, he infused heliobi into swords and forged swords that could grant their wielders strength and valor, and even make decisions for them.\nHowever, these swords would absorb all the anger, fear, and bloodlust they experienced during countless battles, becoming \"cursed swords.\" The soldiers wielding them were consumed by malice, turning into puppets possessed by their swords. Despite the devastating effects, outworlders encouraged Hanguang to keep forging cursed swords. Obsessed with becoming a famed swordsmith, and spurred on by outworlders claiming they needed his swords for all sorts of reasons, he forged a total of 1,382 heliobus cursed swords.[9]\nSometime in the past, Ardens Regia, the high elder of the Xianzhou Zhuming, sent a Vidyadhara craftsman to the Luofu to teach the masters of the Luofu Artisanship Commission about craftsmanship. The craftsman then started their hatching rebirth with the intent to pass back their improved knowledge back to the Zhuming after their rebirth.[30]\nAround the time of the Third War of Abundance, Yunhua, the Luofu's Cauldron Master, and her apprentice, Lingsha were banished to the Zhuming. During her stay, Lingsha studied under Ardens Regia.[31]\nOne day, the Flamewheel Forge was overrun by visitors from afar. The chaos of the mob eventually broke out into a massacre. Hanguang was fatally stabbed by one of the swords he forged. Though many other people died, including Yunli's mother, Yunli managed to escape and was later adopted by Huaiyan. Yunli grew to resent her father for his sins and made a vow to hunt down all the cursed swords he forged, becoming a sword hunter of the Flamewheel Octet.[9]\nIn recent history, Crimson Thorn, one of Huanguang's cursed swords, had fallen into the hands of Thanjar, a member of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. Scouts of the Goldencrow Fleet traced Thanjar to the depths of Insumousu, where he was found impersonating a Xianzhou citizen to coerce locals and water dwellers to salvage various sunken Daiyu relics for him. Yunli spent nearly a month hunting him down on Thalassa until she faced him combat, defeating him and retrieving Crimson Thorn.[32]\nIn November, Year 8098 Star Calendar, the Xianzhou Zhuming reported that it was moored in the Le Roy Ladurie cluster's Stella Yamazaki star system, inside the territory of the Klimt Republic. The Zhuming is set to remain there for 10 Star Calendar years to conduct scientific exchanges. They hoped to deploy advanced forging technology in exchange for some of the rich local mineral deposits.[33]\nOn August 2, Year 8100 Star Calendar, Lingsha is appointed as the new Cauldron Master of the Alchemy Commission aboard the Xianzhou Luofu.[34]\n1 Character matches the category selection:\n"

Special ingenia are placed in the prison to continuously deplete its energy. Anyone in contact with it must wear a talisman or reside in an isolated room to avoid its influence on the mind. General Huaiyan has unrestricted access to visit the Flint Emperor.[3]\nBy imprisoning the progenitor of heliobi, the Flint Emperor, the artisans have obtained a literally inexhaustible power source. The Flamewheel Forge has intricate branch-like track systems that cover the star as much as possible, and the delicate boughs and leaves are choked with receptors and transmitters that guide the Flint Emperor to provide energy for all technological developments.[4] On the outermost skirts of the aurora-inducing particles dispersed with the Flint Emperor's breaths, heliobi are born.

Those who gained immortality were inflicted with Mara, went insane, and turned into beasts. Later, the Luofu came under the protection of the Aeon Lan, who shattered the tree, leaving it as a stump.[1]\nDuring the Era of Bloodshed, the Xianzhou Alliance encountered a Dyson tree, also the mortal enemy of the Primeval Imperium — Muldrasil, homeland of the Wingweavers, feeding off nearby stars, and a war broke out as a result.

To accomplish this, Imbibitor Lunae Yubie, high elder of the Luofu at the time, made the decision to flood Scalegorge Waterscape with the waters of the ancient sea in order to help the Luofu seal the Ambrosial Arbor.[4] Starskiff seeds were developed from the Ambrosial Arbor.[5]\nIn the Year 7379 Star Calendar, Imbibitor Lunae Dan Feng would go on to commit a great crime and sin by invoking the Transmutation Arcanum, embracing immorality and breaking the ban, thieving immortality and inciting riot.[6] Dan Feng made changes to the Transmutation Arcanum; allowing other species to be incorporated into the Vidyadhara, giving the Vidyadhara the possibility of replenishing their population and created a draconic abomination that wreaked great destruction on Scalegorge Waterscape, which the remaining members of the Quintet were forced to put down, resulting in damage to the seals. The creation of Bailu, her instatement as Dan Feng's successor as High Elder, and the dragon heart going missing were also a result of this incident.[7] The Cloud Knights joined forces with the Vidyadhara Preceptors to assault him, Dan Feng was captured and his punishment was carried out; he went through molting rebirth and his subsequent incarnation was held in the Shackling Prison for a period of time before being exiled from the Luofu, leaving the Ambrosial Arbor unguarded for over 700 years.[8]\nSometime around the Year 8100 Star Calendar, amidst the Stellaron Crisis, the Ambrosial Arbor was revived using the power of a Stellaron that was smuggled aboard the Luofu. The events were masterminded by Lord Ravager Phantylia who intended to dismantle the Xianzhou from within, and used the power of the Arbor to create a new body for herself. General Jing Yuan and the Astral Express Crew headed into Scalegorge Waterscape to confront Phantylia after Dan Heng, Dan Feng's reincarnation, undid the already weakened seals in Dragon Palace. At the roots of the Arbor, they fought a tough battle, but eventually defeated the Lord Ravager.[9] Sometime afterward, Dan Heng would meet with High Elder Bailu at Dragonvista Rainhall in order to help repair the seals to the roots of the Ambrosial Arbor in the Lunarescent Depths, where they discover that Bailu had inherited Dan Feng's healing and restorative abilities while Dan Heng did not.[7]\n"

        "content": "The Xianzhou Luofu (Chinese: 仙舟「罗浮」 Xiānzhōu \"Luófú\") is one of the six Flagships owned by the Hexafleet of the Xianzhou Alliance. It sails like a one-way arrow through the galaxy, with the goal of eradicating Denizens of Abundance. The Luofu stands out among the other ships for its medical treatment and trade. People on the Luofu are considered laid-back compared to other ships.[1]\nIt is the third world that can be accessed upon completing the Trailblaze Mission chapter In the Sweltering Morning Sun.\nThe Trailblaze Mission Chapters Windswept Wanderlust, Topclouded Towerthrust and Karmic Clouds Faded, War Banners Folded take place in this world.\nFrom the outside, the Luofu resembles an enormous Starskiff, its deck covered with several large, connected domes - each containing a different delve of the ship. 3/4 down the hull is a large ring which circles nearly the entire ship, save for a gap at the top. Floating between this gap is the \"Jade Gate\", the main point of entry and exit for anyone visiting the massive ship.\nThe inside of the Luofu comprises of delves which total space exceeds the ship in size. This is possible due to the Xianzhou's space-folding technology. These delves all varied in size and shape, but they were all on a scale that was just too large for any normal ship to contain. Some of the delves could hold up entire residential and commercial districts, such as Exalting Sanctum, while others could even contain vast luxuriant prairies like the Ever-Hunt Plains, which hosts fauna such as monkeys and fawn. \nThe Xianzhou also rears several other animals in the Ever-Hunt Plains such as the Fungus Boar, Yellow Boulder, Tuskpir, Gentle Halcyon and Downy Antler. Depth crawlers were a type of creature that was similar to void song whales that once lived on the Luofu, but have been extinct for thousands of years.[2] While plants of the Tian Dong genus typically grow on land, Tian Dong plants of Scalegorge Waterscape stand out by extensively inhabiting the coastal areas of the Lunarescent Depths. Scalegorge alginate, Lunarescent Sea mint, and Dragon Scale Coral can also be harvested for medicinal purposes.[3]\nStrange planets can be seen high in the sky, though some of them may be a projection of the delve's artificial sky dome. The Realm-Keeping Commission's weather pavilion manages the environmental conditions on the Luofu, including the artificial wind, clouds, rain, and fog.[4] Heat is extracted from the core of the planet the ship is carrying to keep some of the delves warm.[5]\nThe visible space in the bustling skyport of Central Starskiff Haven is enough to fill up the entire Luofu. The bustling street of Starwatcher Avenue can also be found here, where shops line the road for as far as the eye can see, and their lights are lit for perpetuity. The Sky-Faring Commission's headquarters on the Luofu is the Palace of Astrum, which also acts as the ship's bridge. Cloudford is the trade cargo port of the Loufu. With the arrival of numerous Outworlders, Starskiff Haven is alive with people from all walks of life. Goods from various worlds are delivered by transport starskiffs and unloaded at Cloudford, and every day it unceasingly handles huge amounts of port traffic.[6][7]\nStarskiffs on the Luofu are manufactured in Stargazer Navalia. Aurum Alley is the Exalting Sanctum's signature food street where tourists come to enjoy delicious food, from traditional dishes to roadside snacks, and experience street culture. The freight dock managed by the Aurum Alley Merchant Guild is mainly used for distributing commodities and logistics transportation. Fyxestroll Garden is garden delve created centuries ago by Foxian crafters temporarily occupied by the Ten-Lords Commission as the imprisonment site for Heliobi that escaped from the Artisanship Commission's Creation Furnace. \nThe Divination Commission hosts the Luofu's Matrix of Prescience Ultima. Conclave Hall is the official location in the Divination Commission delve where issues are discussed publicly. The Seat of Divine Foresight is office of the Arbiter-General of the Luofu. The Luofu's Alchemy Commission borders the Vidyadhara delve of Scalegorge Waterscape which hosts the sealed entrance to the Ambrosial Arbor, the Luofu's Plaguemark. The Alchemy Commission's medical texts are kept in the Elixir Research Terrace, a building looking out over the sea. Medicine and traders flock to Healer's Market. In the past, only Elixir Seekers with permits could enter here to buy divine medicines. Healers gather to conduct medical research in the Medicine Bureau. The tree in its garden is one of Ambrosial Arbor's roots.\nA statue of Imbibitor Lunae can be found at Dragonvista Rain Hall, which sits the entrance to the Ancient Sea Palace Ruins. The enormous dragon palace of the Vidyadhara is buried in the seafloor valley, along with many Vidyadhara eggs preparing for hatching-rebirth. Hindered by the seal, the Ambrosial Arbor's roots curl into a dragon-shaped wood gall at the Palace Ruin Depths, and no longer grows. Desalinated Lunarescent Seawater and Scalegorge Spring Water are potable. Beneath Scalegorge Waterscape is the entrance to the Luofu's Shackling Prison, which is spread out throughout multiple delves.[8]\nAside from the above mentioned delves, there is also the Polar Delve and Cold Springs delve.[8][9]\nThere are 3 Space Anchors in Central Starskiff Haven:\nThere is 1 Space Anchor in Palace of Astrum:\nThere are 4 Space Anchors in Cloudford:\nThere are 4 Space Anchors in Stargazer Navalia:\nThere are 2 Space Anchors in Exalting Sanctum:\nThere is 1 Space Anchor in Seat of Divine Foresight:\nThere are 2 Space Anchors in Aurum Alley:\nThere are 4 Space Anchors in Divination Commission:\nThere are 4 Space Anchors in Artisanship Commission:\nThere are 4 Space Anchors in Fyxestroll Garden:\nThere are 4 Space Anchors in Alchemy Commission:\nThere are 3 Space Anchors in Scalegorge Waterscape:\nThere are 6 Space Anchors in The Shackling Prison:\nThere are 7 Space Anchors in Skysplitter:\n16 Characters match the category selection:\nThere are 172 additional NPCs related to The Xianzhou Luofu:\nThere are 10 mentioned characters related to The Xianzhou Luofu:\nThere are no upcoming NPCs related to The Xianzhou Luofu.\n"

        "content": "Unlike the other Xianzhou ships, the Xuling has no Vidyadhara High Elder and no known plaguemark.\nThe ship is currently populated by aurumatons instead of living beings,[1] although this was not always the case.[2] The Xuling has its own species of Cypress tree that can live for over two thousand years.[3]\nAccording to protocol, those who commit great crimes, such as trying to undermine the Alliance, are to be held on trial on the Xuling before the Ten-Lords Commission and the Seven Arbiter-Generals.[4] Jingliu claimed that she once drew the gaze of an Aeon through the deep recesses of the Ten-Lords Commission on the Xuling, through the Gate of Wonders.[5]\nOn April, Year 2607 Star Calendar during the Theophany Era, homeostasis was completely paralyzed in three of the Xianzhou Xuling's delves, delivering catastrophic flooding, mass deaths, and uncountable losses. The Xuling nobles ordered grain transfer and opened state coffers for the rescue effort. The other Xianzhou ships dispatched reinforcements, and a new lease on life was won.[2]\nAt the end of Year 2609 Star Calendar, the Xianzhou Xuling, along with the Yuque, the Yuanqiao, and the Cangcheng, all introduced their own Yellowjacket Census and Almanacs, advising of all death revitalizations on Xianzhou for that year. During the formation of the Xianzhou Alliance, the seven ships gathered with a Xuling messenger to authenticate, share content, and review the details. This declaration is the final product, hereby creating the Xianzhou Alliance.[2]\nDuring the Era of Bloodshed, in the war against Muldrasil, the force of the Reignbow Arbiter's Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow caused great casualties among even the furthest ships, the Fanghu and Xuling, which were the furthest away in the battle formation.[6]\nIn October, Year 8098 Star Calendar, the Xuling reported \"Business as usual here.\" Xikui of the Luofu Sky-Faring Commission remarked that she still had no idea where exactly the Xuling was. Yukong, the Helm Master, said that this was normal.[7]\nAfter the Stellaron Crisis on the Xianzhou Luofu in Year 8100 Star Calendar, Jingliu and Luocha were to be sent to the Xuling to be held for a joint trial. However, after General Jing Yuan reported the events to Marshal Hua, General Yaoguang took an interest in their case, and had the Deca-Light Reflection Barrier set up, detouring the two to the Xianzhou Yuque.[4]\n"

        "session_name": "the Xianzhou Fanghu",
        "url": "https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com//wiki/The_Xianzhou_Fanghu",
        "content": "On the Fanghu, the High Elder Glaciator Marum governs over all citizens, and the Six Charioteers and Six Commissions support the High Elder. It is because of their influence that the Pearlkeepers aboard the Fanghu formed an elite force that have essentially replaced the role of the Cloud Knights there.[3]\nThe Fanghu is an autonomous dominion of the Vidyadhara, and thusly has different customs, culture, and social structures from other Xianzhou ships. Reading materials such as the Fanghu Lifestyle Guide from the Star-Picking Tours are recommended to avoid unintended mistakes. Vidyadhara roaming around the Miniature Myriads and Pearlkeepers meditating are common sights on the Fanghu. The sound of belligerent dragon chants echoes through space from time to time.[4] Roiling Deep water from the Fanghu can be used in prescriptions. A species of black viper can also be found on the Fanghu. The Fanghu also has it's own species of longan. Fanghu Fossil Root and Dragon Scale Coral also has medicinal uses.[5]\nAccording to the regional policy, a Xianzhou Alliance Travel Pass and a Fanghu Travel Pass, which must be applied for two-to-three months in advance, are required to travel in the Fanghu. The same rules apply to Xianzhou citizens. Those whose residency papers are under the jurisdiction of the Xianzhou Alliance are required to provide the certificate of conduct issued by the Realm-Keeping Commission of their domicile to the Sky-Faring Commission of the Fanghu. Travelers from other worlds are required to provide the certificate of conduct issued by their place of residence and the certificate of no criminal record issued by the IPC.\nThough this procedure is slightly complicated, the Fanghu-issued travel pass remains valid for 20 years, so the process does not have to be repeated often. The Xianzhou Fanghu used to be the most famous tourist attraction of the Xianzhou Alliance. Unfortunately, the place could no longer accommodate vast numbers of tourists in recent years, and even stopped issuing new travel passes briefly due to the damage inflicted by the Third Abundance War. After the new travel policy was put into place, the ship opened up to visitors once more.[6]\nVidyadhara on the Fanghu enjoy a number of welfare benefits compared to other Xianzhou ships. For example, on the Fanghu, upon completing their hatching rebirth, the newborn Vidyadhara is immediately assigned a new residence without having to go through the standard real estate paperwork, which is an inconvenience to Vidyadhara who cannot keep track of their past lives. It is said that in regards to registering hatching rebirths, the Fanghu's Realm-Keeping Commission is more competent. Additionally, the water quality on the Fanghu is said to be better than other Xianzhou ships.[7]\nThe Claretgleam Bay in the Sanze Delve is the first stop for most travelers who visit the Fanghu. Many are immediately impressed by the water that flows peacefully on top of the dome of the delve the moment they disembark from their starskiffs. Many might have already witnessed this scene through an immersia or hologram before their arrival. Shangguan Sea Snakes can be seen gliding past with their massive bodies, along with the Lantern Fish sparkling like fireflies when they huddle together, and the Srimanth Conches hunting for schools of fish like nimble missiles.[6]\nThe Reignbow's Road Museum is located in the East Sea Delve. Its name in full is \"Third Abundance War Reignbow's Road Museum.\" As the entire East Sea Delve was razed to the ground during the war, the museum was built upon the ruins. In Reignbow's Road Museum, a holographic History of Reignbow's Road formed using the Vidyadhara's cloudhymn magic is displayed. The exhibit shows how the catastrophe took place and how the Abundance Axis launched an aggressive attack against the Fanghu, and how the Pearlkeepers put up a tenacious defense, but to no avail as the Abundance Axis managed to invade the delve in the end. To prevent further destruction, the Reignbow Arbiter appeared to wipe out the fleet of the Abundance Axis with divine arrows and annihilated many corrupted delves. Among them, East Sea Delve was the only one that was simply \"reduced to ruins.\"[6]\nWhat is described as the most stunning exhibition hall in the museum is the Palace of Mortal World, where the Fanghu and IPC have built a replica of Moundfish Avenue, the busiest area in East Sea Delve before the war. The daily lives of the 39,823 residents is manifested in the form of Mirage Echoes showing their comings and goings prior to the disaster. The Mirage Echoes can hold conversation, and are described as ordinary people who probably never expected they would perish during the war. Reignbow's Road Museum offers free entry to travelers as the citizens of Fanghu want to show more people the purpose behind the Xianzhou Alliance's endeavors.[6]\nThe Wild Shore is the most renowned beach in the Fanghu. Despite the complicated travel pass application procedure, the attraction still welcomes almost 70 million travelers every year. The biggest appeal of the Wild Shore is that it is both a hot spring and a beach. The water there is rich in microbes beneficial for the health of one's skin, and the shore is blessed with a magnificent stretch of white sand and beautiful natural scenery. However, its extreme popularity is its most significant drawback as aside the off-season, the sands are crowded with tourists.[6]\nIn front of the entrance to the Fanghu's Alchemy Commission stands a statue of dragon scale coral. Underneath it, there is an inscription that reads: \"When you mistakenly believe you can control nature, always remember: nature is the ultimate biochemist.\"[8]\nIn the Theophany Era, on December, Year 2607 Star Calendar, the Xianzhou Fanghu, alongside the Yaoqing and Zhuming, introduced its own Yellowjacket Census and Almanacs, advising of all death revitalizations on Xianzhou for that year.[9]\nDuring the Era of Bloodshed, the Xianzhou Alliance encountered a Dyson tree called Muldrasil, homeland of the Wingweavers, feeding off nearby stars. As if attracted by the power of the Ambrosial Arbor on the Luofu, Muldrasil began to approach it, and war broke out between the Xianzhou and the Denizens of Abundance residing in the tree.\nFatigued from the Civil War, the aurumaton rebellion, and their emigration plan, all the prisoners in cryo-hibernation were released to counter the invasion — including the Reignbow, who made a deal with the Flint Emperor, allowing the latter to possess their physical body in exchange for the power of the Heliobi. Inspired by the Reignbow's sacrifice, the Xianzhou residents make the same deal, forming suicide squads and marching alongside the Heliobi. During the battle, the Reignbow shot their Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow from the bow of the Yaoqing, using their famed bow \"Xuanyuan\", causing great casualties among even the furthest ships, the Xuling and Fanghu, which was the third-furthest away in the battle formation. The arrow smashed into the Ambrosial Arbor, severing the connection between the Luofu and Muldrasil.[10]\nIn the Year 4800 Star Calendar, the five lineages of the Vidyadhara made an alliance on the Yuque, putting their sacred vow into writing: \"This oath shall remain unbroken, standing stronger than even earth and steel.\" Glaciator Marum signed the covenant with the Xianzhou Alliance on behalf of the Vidyadhara, and the five High Elders were bound to keep watch over the respective plaguemarks of each Xianzhou ship. Glaciator Marum was bound to watch over the Miniature Myriads on the Fanghu.[11] As a reward, the Alliance granted the Vidyadhara the Xianzhou Fanghu to rule as an autonomous ship.[7]\nDuring an unnamed conflict on Thalassa, the Fanghu's Ebonpearl Fleet was considered for deployment, as they had Vidyadhara cloudhymn magi capable of stopping the Devil's Tide. Ultimately, the Generals decided to use the Heroncrest of the Yaoqing instead, as the Fanghu was too far away, and current forces would've had to withstand multiple counterattacks from the enemy for six months before the Fanghu arrived.[12] At some point in history, the Fanghu, alongside the Yaoqing and Zhuming, engaged in warfare against Lord Ravager Celenova and her troops.[13][14]\nIn the Year 8038 Star Calendar, borisin Yewliho led her fleet, the Preta, with 127 men remaining, to the Fanghu, determined to submit and pledge allegiance to the Alliance after the death of her son at the hands of borisin Bloodwind Pack Chief Kobo. After two long years of careful deliberation, the Alliance decided to pardon these borisin for their crimes and allow them to live inside the Fanghu under strict surveillance. This was on the condition that they comply with all Alliance research on borisin, as well as submitting all beast ship-related technology to them. This was also the time that Zongguang met Yewliho. As a cultural anthropologist, they were ordered to interview the 127 borisin, in order to deepen the Xianzhou's understanding of borisin society. Throughout the course of their research, Yewliho and Zongguang developed a deep friendship.\nLikely because of her hatred towards Kobo, Yewliho always hoped that she would be able to lead her Preta to fight for the Alliance. However, a request like this was unlikely to receive approval. Yewliho made this request again and again and was rejected every time. After 30 years, she could bear this cycle no longer and began to seek Zongguang's assistance. Zongguang suggested that she write a long letter explaining her life and background in detail. This would allow her to explain her hatred of her enemies to the Seven Arbiter-Generals and why she longed to fight for the Alliance.[15]\nIn the year 8072 Star Calendar, during the Third Abundance War, the Yaoqing and Fanghu alerted the Luofu about the assembly of the Denizens of Abundance, the revival of the living planet Ketu Mirage, and their attack on the Fanghu. The Luofu dispatched four brigades of Cloud Knights to help them fight, but they were still in a dire situation. Yewliho had finished writing My Return to the Path around this time, and without receiving permission from the Alliance, Yewliho and the Preta launched their final assault, killing an unknown number of Denizens of Abundance.[15]\nFu Xuan and Jing Yuan, a Diviner and Arbiter-General of the Luofu, came up with a plan to contact the Reignbow Arbiter using the Yuque's Cloudpeer Telescope. The Reignbow Arbiter then descended onto the battlefield and annihilated the borisins' fleet using their Lux Arrow, and nearly one-fifth of the Xianzhou Fanghu's delves were destroyed by the Lux Arrow's bombardment. Yewliho and the Preta managed to transport at least 4,000 civilians to safety before the Reignbow's Lux Arrow descended. During this process, all 127 borisin warriors, including Yewliho perished.[16][15]\nEver since the Third Abundance War, the Fanghu had adopted self-preservation policies to recuperate. As a result, they had cut off most of their regular communications and trade with the other Xianzhou ships, a decision from the Fanghu's high elder, Glaciator Marum, implicitly stemming from the Vidyadhara's inability to produce offspring. After the new travel policy was put into place, the ship opened up to visitors once more.[6]\nOn April, Year 8098 Star Calendar, the Fanghu announced on the Yellowbell system that they were currently moored at the Lanadi star system in the Tlaltecuhtli star cluster, a system with no terrestrial planets, except for one with a rudimentary ecosystem. The Fanghu had determined this to be a hidden star system with no ecosphere within several light years' range, meaning it could easily evade attacks from the Denizens of Abundance or the Antimatter Legion. Presently the Fanghu is expected to moor there for some ten Star Calendar years, unless unforeseen circumstances are to transpire.[17]\n"

        "url": "https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com//wiki/The_Xianzhou_Yuque",
        "content": "The Yuque was the birthplace of the Divination Commission, where the stargazers and diviners gathered to observe the stars and plot the path ahead for the Alliance.[3] As such, they use powerful devices such as the Deca-Light Reflection Barrier Matrix to draw information from the past and predict the future by interpreting hexagrams[4], and the Cloudpeer Telescope, the ultimate astronomical observation device in the Alliance that can detect traces and signals of the Reignbow Arbiter's Lux Arrow and manifestations.[3] The Cloudpeer Telescope was described as standing tall like a towering spire reaching into the sky.[5] Not only could it scry into the distance, it can also be used to send out information. The stargazers steer the Cloudpeer Telescope and peer into the depths of the stars. In the midst of the gloom, the spinning jade abacus emanates a radiance, guiding the ship to its bright destination.[6]\nPer the Surveillance Report sent to the Seat of Divine Foresight in the Luofu, the Yuque is currently located around the Giant's Arm star cluster.[7] Yuque Imperial Serum is a type of medicine used in prescriptions.[8]\nAt the end of the Year 2609 Star Calendar in the Theophany Era, the Xianzhou Yuque, along with the Yuanqiao, Cangcheng, and Xuling all introduced their own Yellowjacket Census and Almanacs, advising of all death revitalizations on Xianzhou for that year. On May, Year 3061 Star Calendar, the coarse rioted on the Xianzhou Yuque but was suppressed by nobility. Subsequent rebellions occurred on April and July the following year, 3062 Star Calendar. Both were suppressed by the nobles.[9]\nDuring the Era of Bloodshed, the Xianzhou Alliance encountered a Dyson tree called Muldrasil, homeland of the Wingweavers, feeding off nearby stars. As if attracted by the power of the Ambrosial Arbor on the Luofu, Muldrasil began to approach it, and war broke out between the Xianzhou and the Denizens of Abundance residing in the tree.\nFatigued from the Civil War, the aurumaton rebellion, and their emigration plan, all the prisoners in cryo-hibernation were released to counter the invasion — including the Reignbow, who made a deal with the Flint Emperor, allowing the latter to possess their physical body in exchange for the power of the Heliobi. Inspired by the Reignbow's sacrifice, the Xianzhou residents make the same deal, forming suicide squads and marching alongside the Heliobi. During the battle, the Reignbow shot their Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow from the bow of the Yaoqing, using their famed bow \"Xuanyuan\", causing great casualties among even the furthest ships, the Xuling and Fanghu, which was the third-furthest away in the battle formation. The arrow smashed into the Ambrosial Arbor, severing the connection between the Luofu and Muldrasil.\nAround 5,000 years ago, the Wisdom Sapientia Academe was formed on the Yuque, providing a constant supply of talented technicians who believed in the Wisdomwalker to various Xianzhou commissions. Not a single Xianzhou person who believed in the Reignbow Arbiter had any issues with the arrangement. Many intellectuals abandoned their old paths for good and chose to follow the Wisdomwalker on the Path of Erudition. They were called the Wisdom Sect. Most Wisdom Sect members preferred to focus on academic research in their ivory towers, rather than spending time on secular matters. Hence, their presence was not felt much during the Crisis of Belief era. The Wisdom Sect still exists today, although it is hardly known and only has a small group of followers left.[10]\nIn The Year 4800 of the Star Calendar, the five lineages of the Vidyadhara made alliance on the Yuque, putting their sacred vow into writing: \"This oath shall remain unbroken, standing stronger than even earth and steel.\" Mons Grandis was bound to watch over the Fallow Earth on the Yuque.[11]\nStargazers of the Yuque once produced 152 consecutive years' worth of observational records about the dead planet Syracuse-III and watched as the Antimatter Legion crept very slowly toward this front line, building up an advantage, exerting pressure, and chipping away at any resistance. They speculated that behind the scenes lay an Overlord with a calm and self-sufficient temperament. Based on IPC records, at least 122 planets were plunged into chaos of unknown origin over the past 600 years before their ultimate demise at the hands of the Antimatter Legion. The Yuque's Divination Commission attributed these series of events to another unseen Lord Ravager. The Yuque's Divination Commission observed the destruction of Muldrasil around the year 5320 Star Calendar. The Antimatter Legion destroyed the wingweavers' home almost instantly. According to the speculations of the Yuque's Divination Commission, there may be other worlds like Muldrasil.[12]\nDuring the resistance of the alliance against the Abominations of Abundance, the Intelligentsia Guild once dispatched a troop consisting of the Learned to join the 2nd of the Abundance Wars in Year 5749 Star Calendar. The troop helped in defeating Shuhu, an Abundance Emanator that besieged the Yuque.[13] At some point in history, the Xianzhou Yuque was rescued by the High-Cloud Quintet.[14]\nDuring an unnamed conflict on Thalassa, the Yuque's Echojade Fleet laid out a defense in coordination with the Yaoqing's encirclement and eradication of abominations. The Yuque's Master Diviner, Jingtian, determined the outcome of the battle and relayed it to the Arbiter-Generals, who in turn deployed Heroncrest Fleet of the Yaoqing instead of the Fanghu. Though the Fanghu's Ebonpearl Fleet could have stopped the abominations with their Vidyadhara cloudhymn magi, they were too far away, and current forces on the battlefield would have had to withstand multiple counterattacks from the enemy for six months before Fanghu reinforcements arrived. They pressed a strong offense for some time, but lost any hope of success thereafter due to the Devil Tide of Thalassa.[15]\nIn the year 8072 Star Calendar, during the Third Abundance War, the Yaoqing and Fanghu alerted the Xianzhou Luofu about the assembly of the Denizens of Abundance, the revival of the living planet Ketu Mirage, and their attack on the Fanghu. The Luofu dispatched four brigades of Cloud Knights to help them fight, but they were still in a dire situation. Diviner Fu Xuan of the Luofu proposed a plan to the Six Charioteers to contact the Reignbow Arbiter using the Yuque's Cloudpeer Telescope, which would be shipped to the Fanghu using a Navis Astriger. The Yuque's Master Diviner, Jingtian, was the only person who has the permission to use the Cloudpeer Telescope and could send out a signal in the format of the Reignbow's decree. The Reignbow Arbiter then descended onto the battlefield and annihilated the borisins' fleet using their Lux Arrow, and nearly one-fifth of the Xianzhou Fanghu's delves were destroyed by the Lux Arrow's bombardment. Master Diviner Jingtian perished in the collateral destruction.[16][3]\nOn July, Year 8098 Star Calendar, the Yuque reported continuing their explorations along an ancient shipping lane.[17] Sometime in the present, the Xianzhou Yuque was trekking around the periphery of the Giant's Arm star cluster, plotting an ancient course as it continued its explorations. The ship's Cloudpeer Telescope captured signals from Reignbow's Lux Arrow traversing through three of its coordinates. The master diviner interpreted this as a divine mandate, and the Marshal issued orders for the Xianzhou Yaoqing Cloud Knights' Heroncrest Fleet and Red Ballad Fleet to both set out on patrol as hereby informed. In their recent observations, the Yuque Divination Commission reported that the Brood Lord Aksin led his hunting pack against the Shepherds fleet near the Echidna skywall in an internal war between the Borisins. \nThey also learned from the IPC's data that the wingweavers' Peacock Angel legion had arrived at the Consternation Starzone to locate a Stellaron and revive their homeworld of Muldrasil. They also observed that the Baranza Forge, an industrial planet along the Luofu's route, had been completely neutralized by the Lord Ravager Irontomb's assault, deeming it a medium-low threat to the Luofu and advised the Divination Commission to monitor electrical signals from Irontomb's vehicle.[7] At one point, the Yuque was searching for the leader of the Galaxy Rangers, La Mancha, hoping to rebuild a connection with the hero. It is unknown if they are still pursuing this endeavor.[18]\nAfter the Stellaron Crisis on the Xianzhou Luofu around the Year 8100 Star Calendar, Jingliu and Luocha were to be sent to the Xianzhou Xuling to be held for a joint trial before the Ten-Lords Commission and the Seven Arbiter-Generals according to protocol. However, after General Jing Yuan reported the events to Marshal Hua, General Yaoguang took an interest in their case, and had the Deca-Light Reflection Barrier set up, detouring the two to the Yuque.[19] Master Diviner Fu Xuan had also been summoned to the Yuque for questioning and to meet General Yaoguang.[20][21]\n"

THEY are the overall main antagonist of the game.\nWitnessing the destruction in Adlivun as the world was marred by The Swarm and the Mechanical Empire during their birth, Nanook sees the creation of the universe as a mistake and seeks to destroy everything. After ascending to Aeonhood, Nanook allegedly ignited THEIR home world.[4]\nDespite being the most recently ascended Aeon, Nanook and THEIR minions may already be considered the greatest menace in all the galaxy.[5]\nNanook often appears as a human male that has long white hair, with long braids, brown skin and golden eyes. A giant scar, along with multiple smaller scars, is seen on THEIR chest as golden ichor seeps out. A quarter of THEIR arms are floating, and half of THEIR lower body is golden flames and black smoke, indicating THEIR path of destruction.\nNanook is the youngest Aeon and did not exist at the time of the Swarm Disaster.[4]\nNanook came from a star system called Adlivun. Adlivun was a world marred by the Emperor's War and was also in the path of the Swarm. Akivili visited Adlivun when it was still fighting a war with the descendants of the Imperator Insectorum. Adlivun was destroyed and Nanook probably ignited it THEMSELF.[4]\nLord Ravagers are Emanators of Destruction recruited by Nanook from the worlds they have destroyed. They are remade by Nanook in the world of the Warforge and each represent a different aspect of Destruction.[6] There are seven Lord Ravagers, five of whom have known names: Phantylia,[7] Zephyro, Celenova, Irontomb, Sun Devourer.[8] There also used to be a Lord Ravager called Zulo who was replaced by Celenova.[9]\nNanook destroyed a White Star named Fetora. The flames of the White Star coalesced with the power of Destruction to give birth to plasmic lifeforms. The fire demon Ifrit also known as Duke Inferno was born and has been obsessed with destruction and slaughter since birth. The embers left behind from the star's destruction were clasped in Ifrit's own hands, molded into the shape of Fetora's crown, and worn to this day.[10] Ifrit would later go on to lead the Ever-Flame Mansion, a subgroup of the Annihilation Gang.[11]\nDuring the Antimatter Legion's attack on the Herta Space Station, when the Trailblazer protects March 7th from the attack of Doomsday Beast, Nanook gazes at the Trailblazer.[12]\nAfter Fu Xuan interrogated Kafka aboard the Xianzhou Luofu, Kafka revealed to the Trailblazer that they will eventually face Nanook in the best and the worst cases. When that time comes, the Trailblazer will need all the help they can get, and it will be a brutal struggle of Aeonic proportions. In the vast majority of futures, that's when destiny ends. But if they follow Elio's plan, there may be a glimmer of hope on the horizon. Kafka suggests that even Aeons can be killed.[13]\nWhen Nanook appears in the Simulated Universe, the following sound will play: ▶\n...Frankly, I still don't understand why Nanook the Destruction was born. Terminus the Finality was already traversing the universe before Nanook appeared. Is Destruction not included in Finality? We know so little about the secrets of the Paths. From the example of Xipe and Ena, we know that Paths with similar concepts can collide with each other, such as Order being included in Harmony resulting in Xipe absorbing Ena when the former ascended. It feels rather like survival of the fittest. However, there are examples of similar Paths co-existing for different lengths of time, such as Preservation with Remembrance and Abundance with Propagation. I guess perhaps our mortal conclusions about the Paths are still not at a high enough level. The true meaning of a Path cannot be completely expressed with just one word, or perhaps there are even deeper secrets regarding the Paths and the Aeons...\n...Nanook came from a star system called Adlivun, which has now been \"destroyed.\" The birth of an Aeon was often accompanied by an anomaly that shook the universe, and Nanook had probably ignited their own home. I got some information from the Astral Express on how Adlivun used to be. It was a tragic world completely marred by the Emperor's War, and was unfortunate enough to be on the path of the Swarm's march. When Akivili arrived there, Adlivun was still fighting a tense and endless war with the remaining descendants of the Imperator Insectorum. What kind of an Aeon would such a planet create? It is therefore not hard to imagine its eventual fate...\n"

Any object imaginable that can be manufactured, such as weapons, ship parts, ingenious robots, and artificial intelligence are all produced by the craftsmasters here. They pursue ingenious skills and strive for the goal of completing the \"Great Smelting Furnace\" ritual, and being awarded the title of \"Furnace Master.\" Shards of the Lux Arrow can be reforged by the Furnace Master, chief of the Xianzhou artisans, for those who are worthy. \nCountless artisans regard the Xianzhou Zhuming Artisanship Commission, which had swallowed up a Pseudo Sun, as the hallowed hall of the craft, with apprentices who aspire to forge divine tools swarming the institution. With enough force, anything can be crafted, and the Flamewheel Forge has prepared everything the artisans could possibly need. By imprisoning the progenitor of heliobi, the Flint Emperor, the artisans have obtained a literally inexhaustible power source.\nOn the Zhuming, artisanship is the supreme school of learning. All its generals also held the title of the Artisanship Commission's Furnace Master. When they leave the ship, they command thousands of troops. When they return to the ship, they would swing their hammer and forge wondrous items, and receive the people's supreme respect. More than half of the weapons used in the Xianzhou's hunts throughout the fleet's history were forged in the Xianzhou Zhuming. Therefore, the Flamewheel Forge came to be regarded as the holy pilgrimage site for such technologies in the entire Cosmos.\nApprentices from different worlds come together before the Forge and become fellow students, then compete and share their skills. Outworlders who come in search of marvelous tools would also pay a hefty sum to commission artisans to craft otherworldly items — However, the countless apprentices over the millennia have rarely been favored by General Huaiyan, the \"Artisan of Artisans.\" Whenever he tutors students himself and personally passes on his skills both as a craftsman and a soldier, these students would either become grandmasters who leave a mark in the annals as Furnace Masters or become Cloud Knights with names that thunder through the Alliance such as the Flamewheel Octet.[1]\nThe verses \"Smelt for a thousand stars; quicken with steel of heroes. The forge's light boosts power and might; and armaments guard both hearth and meal.\" hang in adornment in the main hall of the Flamewheel Forge. The Artisanship Commission's Hall of Jadeology keeps a close watch over the jade carving process, making it difficult for outworlders to observe the manufacturing process.[2]\nThe Xianzhou Zhuming Artisanship's Temperaflame Office is responsible for taking \"newborn\" harmless heliobi passed to them from the Ten-Lords Commission Flamehunt Judges, and matching the heliobi with various artifacts to make them into lamps, vehicles, and various spectacles in the Zhuming.[3]\nAn unknown emperor of the Primeval Imperium was said to have once gifted the master craftsman of the Zhuming, Grand Artisan Yang Di, with a weapons-casting mold in honor of its maiden voyage. To this day it remains, passed down through the ages to be the pride of place in the Flamedisk Forge Palace, the foundational base of the Xianzhou Zhuming's Artisanship Commission. It was said that the craftsmen on the Zhuming were liberal in form and definition and that the residents had completely transformed the ship beyond recognition since their departure.[4]\nAt the end of the Heliobi Wars, the defeated Heliobi leader, the Flint Emperor, was imprisoned and sentenced to serve as the power source for the Xianzhou Zhuming for the rest of their eternal life. The craftsmen of the Zhuming used every means available to imprison it in the furnace and used its power to forge various divine weapons. It was also rumored that the Creation Furnace in the Xianzhou Luofu was powered by an imprisoned Heliobus.[5] After the Crisis of Belief between the Year 3400 to 4000 Star Calendar, the Firmamend Temple became an affiliated academy of the Zhuming Artisanship Commission.[6]\nIt took the Artisanship Commission of the Xianzhou Yaoqing and 3,000 Vidyadhara craftsmen more than 20 years to build the Caelorum Venti Pavilion in Moon Delve with large slabs of jade and moonstone and is hailed as the epitome of the Yaoqing Vidyadhara architectural style. Vidyadhara Windsayers have laid a \"Feather Path\" in the pavilion that links 16 floating islands together to allow people to walk freely in the air without any flying or floating equipment. The pavilion became one of the most well-known tourist sites of the Yaoqing and commemorates how the previous Caelorum Venti fought valiantly and slew a herd abomination named the Hundred Hands.[7]\nOnce, a delegation containing Baiheng and a dozen others were sent to request for arms and reinforcements from the Zhuming for the Xianzhou Yaoqing's Heroncrest Fleet, who were occupied with fighting the Borisin. They were recieved by General Huaiyan's apprentice, Yingxing, at Radiant Zenith and escorted through by the Flamedisk Forge Palace, where they observed the Flint Emperor's light being sealed. There, they met with Huaiyan, who was willing to allocate three hundred fighter jets, twenty thousand thunder crossbows, and twenty thousand devastator glaives in response to Helm-Master Qingying's request for reinforcements, but only a dozen or so personnel.[4]\nSometime in the past, Ardens Regia, the high elder of the Xianzhou Zhuming, sent a Vidyadhara craftsman to the Luofu to teach the masters of the Luofu Artisanship Commission about craftsmanship. The craftsman then started their hatching rebirth with the intent to pass back their improved knowledge back to the Zhuming after their rebirth.[8] In recent history, Master Gongshu of the Luofu Artisanship Commission had developed a weapon that utilizes heliobus energy called the Luminflux Pyxis.[9]\n"

        "content": "Long ago, Yaoshi had once bestowed the Ambrosial Arbor upon the people of the Xianzhou Luofu, who ate its fruits and thus gained immortality. However, this came with a heavy price, as the people felt the long lasting negative effects of immortality, which they called \"mara.\" They began to resent mara as it turned them into \"beasts.\"[2] Mara seems to inflict victims with inexplicable bloodlust and violent tendencies. When Jingliu became mara-struck, she killed everyone in sight.[3] The bodies of those inflicted by mara grow and mutate until they lose their human form. All long-lived Xianzhou natives will eventually be stricken with mara,[4] unless their lifespans are cut short.\nOver 80% of Xianzhou residents over the age of 800 suffer from being mara-struck, and over 50% fail to celebrate their 900th birthday in a conscious state.[5] Xianzhou natives such as Dahao's father can be afflicted with mara as early as 646 years of age. Dahao's father displayed pre-mara symptoms known as the five decays: he started asking questions about events during Dahao's childhood that Dahao could not even remember, he stopped consuming food and water, and stopped responding to people until he just sat like a corpse. However, when he was taken away by the Ten-Lords Commission, he was still lucid enough to tell Dahao to take care of himself.[6]\nAn autopsy conducted by Dan Shu on the corpse of a mara-struck person who had gone berserk showed that their congenital defects had disappeared. This was not a new discovery, and such observations have been made many times throughout history. There are also no known Incomplete Ones (long-lived beings with congenital defects) among the borisin.[7] It is implied that the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus fed long-lived patients mara-inducing pills that cured them of long-term disabilities, but also caused mental confusion and piercing pain all over the body.[8]\nAccording to Blade, everyone experiences mara in different ways; however, his situation is unusual. Although mara haunts him, memories of it seldom cross his mind, be they of remorse, hatred, fear, or reflection. He describes himself as becoming something else when his mara strikes.[9] Blade had been suffering from memory loss even before the Stellaron Hunters found him.[10]\nThe Disciples of Sanctus Medicus do not consider mara to be a curse, but rather, a stepping stone to ascension given to them by Yaoshi. The form that that they desire is The Ascended, which is the true form \"that cast off the burdens of humanity and has been reforged using the way of immortality.\" It is said that in ancient times, those who sought immortality received wisdom from the Ambrosial Arbor and were able to mold the flesh of themselves and others at will. After countless metamorphoses, they forgot their original appearance. They were known as Celestials.[11]\nAccording to records in the Cloud Knights Marital Doctrine, those who come into contact with Yaoshi can become struck with mara instantly. Even trying to divine the fate of Yaoshi will cause the diviner to become mara-struck. The mara-struck condition in long-life species can also be induced through medicinal pellets and pellet-infused smoke.[12][13][14]\nAccording to Dan Shu, mara is caused by the power of Yaoshi, from whom both the Foxians and Xianzhou natives obtained their long lifespans from. The ultimate secret to their immortality is the ability of their cells to shift between differentiated cells and stem cells when needed without creating a single error. A rule governing this conversion sets a \"standard\" at the moment of an individual's birth, dictating their physical characteristics forever as their immortal cells shift between differentiation and omnipotence. This is called the miracle of the Plagues Author. However, at a certain point in a long-life species' life cycle, the power of Yaoshi enters a new stage and the original standard is replaced, causing the body to develop catastrophically, turning into a \"mindless abomination.\"[13]\nAccording to Fu Xuan, healers believe the mara-struck condition is related to memories; despite their longevity, long-life species still have a limited mental capacity. As time passes, memories fade, but extreme and vivid recollections that are almost certainly filled with negative emotions remain, resulting in the loss of their ability to feel positive emotions. Bailu gives a similar description where the brain can no longer store any more memories and only the most vivid and extreme memories remain, which usually consist of regret, hatred, grief, and other negative emotions. This negative emotional state causes the collapse of the person's ego and starts setting off the mara-struck condition.[12][15] Cases of mara have also been caused by high intensity pain.[7] The Amnesic Meditation Therapy advertisement claims that the root cause of mara is excessive collection of meaningless memories, and recommends removing those memories as a solution.[5] Mara that has been temporarily suppressed by memory erasure can still be set off by over-stimulation, familiar faces, and locations.[10] Retired Cloud Knights are the most likely to be stricken with mara due to post-traumatic stress.[6][16]\nMara is not unique to any one species and affects all long-life species, including Xianzhou natives, Foxians, and the Vidyadhara. However, Foxians usually do not live long enough to be affected by mara, and the Vidyadhara discard their past by molting.[12] Dan Shu adds that the Vidyadhara do not derive their immortality from Yaoshi but Long the Permanence. Due to their unending cycle of reverting from maturity to infancy relying on continuous cellular transdifferentiation, they do not suffer the ailments of immortality that many other long-life species experience.[13] Despite the rarity of naturally mara-struck Foxians and Vidyadhara, they are still susceptible to being inflicted with mara due to artificial means, such as the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus's mara-inducing pellet-infused smoke.[12] During the Ambrosial Arbor's resurrection, Yueyuan had to kill three fellow Vidyadhara who had joined the Disciples and mutated into \"horrific forms.\"[17]\nCountless doctors and sages have tried to find a cure to mara, but none have succeeded.[15]\nAccording to Dahao, mara is more similar to aging than a curable disease. It is inevitable, but can be slowed down and won't cause any harm if it is controlled. When mara is about to strike, the Ten-Lords Commission takes the afflicted away[15] and detains them in the Shackling Prison.[18]\nMara can be temporarily suppressed by removing one's memories or sensory deprivation. Kafka's Spirit Whisper ability is able to temporarily suppress Blade's mara. The process involves removing Blade's memories of the Xianzhou and the High-Cloud Quintet, including himself and practically everything surrounding his relationship with Imbibitor Lunae.[10] An advertisement for the amnesic meditation therapy device claims that by using the device, Xianzhou natives can avoid being mara-struck and live well beyond the usual 800-900 years when they usually succumb to mara. Patients on which the device supposedly worked report forgetting painful memories and their childhood.[5] Jingliu says that she wears a black veil as \"proof of my resolve to never look back, to never fall again into mara and destruction,\"[19] meaning that it prevents her from seeing sights on the Xianzhou that might trigger her mara.[20] According to Luocha, Jingliu has found a solution to mara. Jingliu says that she made a deal that allowed her to retain what life she had left in her. She still retains her sanity, but her mind is at its limits.[3]\nBailu's treatments allowed Banxia to retain her consciousness for a short period of time after she transformed into a Mara-Struck Soldier.[15]\nThe Disciples of Sanctus Medicus use a medication known as the Draught of Draconic Surge that uses the power of Long the Permanence to both trigger and control mara. The Draught is made using living Vidyadhara bone marrow and various other ingredients. Mauve Moon implied that the bone marrow was obtained by force when informing the Trailblazer on how to proceed with collecting the ingredients. The core principle of the Draught is to allow the stem cells in the Vidyahara bone marrow to function in the host. For long-life species, this can trigger mara and cause the bodily organs to \"go out of control in a more controlled manner,\" allowing them to gain the benefits of being mara-struck while retaining their sanity. For short-life species, this medication causes \"a rapid elevation of bodily capacities for a short duration, significantly improving the short-life species' fragile physiologies.\" However, once all the Vidyadhara cells have perished, the host's body suffers a catastrophic regression that can perhaps only be prevented by other drugs from the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. There is no antidote to the Draught. According to the prescription for the Draught, taking this medicine may cause severe pain all over the body, abnormal bone noises, and partial sight and hearing loss. Those who survive gain the way to immortality. The prescription states that Vidyadhara should not take it.[13][21]\nThe Disciples of Sanctus Medicus also have a prescription known as the Semblance Reversion Essence, which allows those whose bodies have been altered by mara to return to their original forms. However, this is only a temporary measure and repeated uses will reduce the prescription's potency until it loses effectiveness completely. The Disciples do not believe being mara-struck can be avoided, only slowed down, and consider it the first step to ascension given to them by Yaoshi.[22]\nDespite the Disciples' supposed ability to control mara, their members who were captured by the Cloud Knights during battle exhibited signs of delusion and hallucination. One disciple saw themselves becoming the storm, the Abundant Ebon Deer, and a scene of leaves and branches covering the sky. Another disciple claimed that to be mara-struck was to eliminate the self, to achieve transcendance, a true life of freedom, and a second life gifted by Sanctus Medicus. The Disciples are also able to elicit uncontrollable mara through smoke infused with medicinal pellets.[12]\nAfter succumbing to mara and going insane, Jingliu managed to escape Starskiff Haven in the Year 7380 Star Calendar and easily froze all the Cloud Knights sent after her before Jing Yuan defeated her in battle.[23] She survived the battle and traveled outside the Luofu for centuries, eventually making a \"deal\" to regain her sanity, which Luocha proposed was a solution to mara.[3]\nYingxing, originally a short-life species human, was affected by mara when he used Shuhu's flesh to help Dan Feng resurrect Baiheng but failed.[3] As a result, he lost his mind and subsequently left the Luofu, eventually coming upon Elio and the Stellaron Hunters, joining them after Elio promised him an \"eternal end and final funeral\" to his life and everything he hated. Kafka regulates his mara by using her Spirit Whisper ability, which appears to work as long as he is kept from being overstimulated or looking at familiar faces too long.[10]\nTwo sisters, Hanya and Xueyi, were stricken with mara centuries prior to the events of the game. Because they showed regret for their actions, the Ten-Lords Commission took pity on the two, granting them another chance in exchange for wiping their previous identities. Hanya \"drank the wine of oblivion,\" using oneiromancy to understand the flow of karma and when mara would occur among Xianzhou natives, while Xueyi was granted an ingenium body to capture evil spirits.[24]\n"

        "content": "There are two different groups of Disciples of Sanctus Medicus who share the same name. The first group, known as the Old Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, was a generally harmless group that worshiped Yaoshi in secrecy for thousands of years until they transformed into the Cold Springs sect. The Cold Springs sect led the Xianzhou in reforming their healthcare system and eventually declared their renouncement of Yaoshi. They believed that mara existed because Yaoshi's will was improperly executed.\nThe more recent Disciples of Sanctus Medicus rose in the wake of the Third Abundance War less than 30 years ago. They operated in secrecy, seeking to lead the Xianzhou Alliance on the Path of Abundance. They believe that mara, rather than being a curse, is a kind of \"blessed evolution.\"[1] The leader, Dan Shu, obtained a Stellaron from Phantylia and revived the Ambrosial Arbor in a rebellion against the Xianzhou. They were defeated by the Cloud Knights of the Luofu with the assistance of the Astral Express Crew, though many still continue to operate in secrecy.\nThey number in the \"tens of thousands\" and have a \"flat\" organizational structure, with the head of each area reporting directly to the master. This is applied so that if their enemies were to wipe out one area of the group, it wouldn't affect the other areas.[1]\nNew members are put through several trials to prove their loyalty. The first is transcribing the Thousand-Handed Merciful Medicus' Salvation scripture 500 times by hand. Another is a fight to the death with another prospective member, though this is possibly made up on the spot by Green Hibiscus due to his suspicion of the Strange Cloud Knight being a spy from the Seat of Divine Foresight. Once accepted into the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, new members are given a new identity.\nThe Disciples of Sanctus Medicus continued to worship Yaoshi as other Aeons like Qlipoth the Preservation, known as the Firmamend Arbiter among the Xianzhou, and Lan the Hunt, became ascendant in the Xianzhou Alliance. Although sharing the same name, the Disciples consist of two distinct groups. The first group, known as the Old Disciples of Sanctus Medicus to differentiate them from the more recent group, believed that the Denizens of Abundance deviated from Yaoshi's will and the mara-struck only existed because Yaoshi's will was improperly executed.[2]\nAfter the Theophany era, countless secret believers of Yaoshi wrote books and established schools to preach the correctness of their beliefs. Others established a medical system rooted in the worship of Yaoshi. The most influential of the books is Yaoshi's Manual of Viscerals. It was the first to systematically establish \"Yaoshi medical sciences\" that connected the science to the worship of Yaoshi. This was the beginning of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. The Manual originally had 75 volumes but the currently available version is a four-volume version re-edited from the remnants of the book by archivists. These residual chapters were mainly taken from sources of the time that rebuked the religion of Sanctus Medicus, and some of them could be inaccurate or completely false.[2]\nThe Old Disciples' first master primus was Yueyan, the Foxian Helm Master of the Xianzhou Yaoqing's Sky-Faring Commission. Yueyan witnessed the destruction of Muldrasil by the Antimatter Legion. Due to Xianzhou's creed of eradicating abominations, the Alliance stood by and observed the entire process. The overwhelming death and destruction shook Yueyan's belief in the long-life species' duty and purpose in life. Yueyan left his position and roamed the stellar seas with a starkiff in search of an answer. He found Shuhu, an Emanator of Yaoshi, on the ancient planet of Rahu and witnessed Shuhu's resurrection of the planet, which had died long ago. The planet throbbed like an embryo in the mother's womb. He followed Shuhu and recorded their healing miracles and various teachings, ultimately composing the Divine Scripture of the Secrets and Miracles of Shuhu's Manifestations.[3]\nA branch of the Old Disciples known as the Inner Secrets Sect authored the Scripture of Yellow Pneuma Yang Essence. The Inner Secrets Sect believed that the Xianzhou natives' bodies possess circulatory vessels similar to the branching form of the Ambrosial Arbor after receiving the blessing of the Arbor and becoming long-life species. These circuits lead toward an organ known as the Core Esse, which is key to the Xianzhou natives' second evolution (alternatively known as the ascension). The Scripture proposed that the body should be considered as soil, the breath considered rain, and combined they nurture the Core Esse (a seed) to spread the circulatory system (as branches), finally achieving an \"inner Ambrosial Arbor\" that thrives and grows as an \"inner secret.\" The Yellow Pneuma mentioned in the book's title is an essence that drives the vitals in the theories of the Inner Secrets Sect, and opposes the Black Prana that symbolizes death and decay. The author believes that the purpose of life is to maintain the presence of Yellow Pneuma and let life continue to evolve. The views of the Inner Secrets Sect are considered superstition.[3]\nThe Old Disciples were not a notorious group for a long time and accepted skepticism with an open mind. They built apothecaries to help the poor and needy. They were treated with pity by those who had long abandoned their belief in Yaoshi but were not particularly detested. They existed in secret for thousands of years and eventually became the Cold Springs sect, which overhauled the entire Xianzhou healthcare system.[2]\nAccording to Overview of Xianzhou's Materia Medica, the Cold Springs sect was formed by young members of the Alchemy Commission and originally named the Cold Springs delve. They re-discovered Liu Hua's Medical Compendium, written by a Vidyadhara who wanted to better explain the principles of Xianzhou medical science using more scientific methods of inquiry, and used it as the standard for medicine. Later, the Cold Springs Sect's innovative thoughts were gradually acknowledged by the various groups in the Alliance, and Liu Hua's Medical Compendium received the credit it deserved.[3]\nAfter the Three Sufferings era, the Xianzhou completely banned belief in Yaoshi. Dan Shu's predecessor, Yunhua, was banished amdist a dispute regarding the Vidyadhara. Their whereabouts are currently unknown.[4][5]\nThe more recent group of Disciples, considered criminals in the Xianzhou, is less than 30 years old and arose in the wake of the Third Abundance War. Some blamed the Alliance and the Hunt for the suffering they endured. They used the same name as the old group, gathered around a \"master primus\", and claimed to have inherited the knowledge and legacy of the Theophany Era. They sought to lead the Xianzhou into the embrace of Yaoshi. In response, the Cold Springs sect published a statement clarifying that they no longer believed in Yaoshi.[2][6]\nThe Master of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, Dan Shu, was motivated by her desire for revenge against Lan The Hunt, who she formerly worshiped. Her friend Yufei died during the Third Abundance War when Lan's Lux Arrow destroyed the enemies as well as the field hospital she was based in. Dan Shu made a deal with Phantylia, a Lord Ravager and Emanator of Nanook the Destruction, to deliver a Stellaron to her. Phantylia arranged for the Stellaron to be brought aboard the Xianzhou by Luocha[7]. Dan Shu used the Stellaron to revive the Ambrosial Arbor and rebel against the Xianzhou, using both the sect and recently acquired Abundance Sprites to cause chaos in various areas of the Luofu.[8] Eventually, her rebellion was stopped by the Xianzhou and Astral Express, though remnants of her sect continue to operate in the shadows.[9][10]\nAccording to the Official Announcement on the Origins of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, the beliefs and texts of these Disciples are almost unrelated to the original Disciples. The Thousand-Handed Merciful Medicus' Salvation that their followers recite daily is a forgery and not a classic text written by the original Disciples, who valued texts such as the Scripture of Yellow Pneuma Yang Essence that provide guidance for spiritual practice.[6]\nWhile the Old Disciples believed that mara was the result of improperly executing Yaoshi's will,[2] Dan Shu's Disciples believed that mara was a kind of blessed evolution. To them, belief in Yaoshi, known as Sanctus Medicus, is the one ultimate faith. To become a disciple, one had to pass trials. The first trial was to copy the Thousand-Handed Merciful Medicus' Salvation 50,000 times. It was later changed to 500 times.[1] The text is considered to be a forgery by the Xianzhou government and unrelated to the Old Disciples.[6] The second trial involved two candidates fighting to the death with the survivor officially becoming a disciple.[1]\nDan Shu's Disciples developed a drug that can induce mara in long-lived species while retaining their sanity. Known as the Draught of Draconic Surge, it is made from various ingredients, but the core ingredient is Vidyadhara bone marrow tissue obtained from a living specimen. When the Trailblazer infiltrated the organization, Mauve Moon told them that they should have no trouble obtaining the rarer ingredients considering their strength, implying that the Vidyadhara bone marrow was obtained using force. An internal prescription circulated among the Disciples says that if one managed to survive the drug, which may cause severe pain all over the body, abnormal bone noises, plus partial loss of sight and hearing, they will attain the way of immortality. However a report prepared by Dan Shu for the Seat of Divine Foresight says that for short-life species, it enhances their bodily capacities for a short period, after which their body suffers a catastrophic regression once all the Vidyadhara cells in the host's body have perished. The only thing preventing such an outcome perhaps being other drugs developed by the Disciples. Dan Shu fed this drug to Xiao Ju, a Xianzhou native, which cured him of of the long term infirmity he has had since he was a child. However the patient reported sharp pain all over his body and mental confusion every time he took the pill.[11][1]\nThey also developed a drug known as the Semblance Reversion Essence that allows the mara-struck who have transformed to revert to their original appearance. However the drug's potency reduces with repeated use and will eventually cease to have any effect. The Disciples do not consider this a permanent solution nor the mara transformation to be undesirable. They believe mara is the first step to ascension given to them by Yaoshi.[11]\nDespite the Disciples' supposed ability to control mara, their members who were captured by the Cloud Knights during battle exhibited signs of delusion and hallucination. One disciple saw themselves becoming the storm, the Abundant Ebon Deer, and a scene of leaves and branches covering the sky. Another disciple claimed that to be mara-struck was to eliminate the self, to achieve transcendance, a true life of freedom, and a second life gifted by Sanctus Medicus. The Disciples are also able to elicit uncontrollable mara through smoke infused with medicinal pellets.[9]\nSome Vidyadhara Preceptors are suspected to have colluded with the Disciples and Dan Shu was in contact with them.[5]\nThe Disciples conducted various experiments using Vidyadhara blood and bone marrow. One experiment conducted during the tenure of Dan Shu's predecessor included injecting Vidyadhara blood and marrow fluid into various species to observe the reactions in their normal and mara-struck states.[4]\n"

        "session_name": "Cloud Knights",
        "url": "https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com//wiki/Cloud_Knights",
        "content": "The Cloud Knights are led by the Seven Arbiter-Generals, the seven top generals and officers of the Cloud Knights within the Xianzhou Alliance known as the vanguards of The Hunt. Every Xianzhou ship operates individually, but the Cloud Knights are all commanded by the Marshal. Therefore, it's normal for Knights to transfer between ships.[1] Appointments are assigned and sent out from the Marshal's Office.[2]\nCloud Knights aboard each ship are generally organized into brigades known as fleets.[3] The Xianzhou Yaoqing, known for its military prowess, has long been standing at the forefront of the most intense combat missions. As the Yaoqing often sails through active war zones, military operations of the Xianzhou Yaoqing is mainly done by the expeditionary fleet as to not endanger the main ship.[4]\nUnder the ferocious assault of the elite Verdant Knights of the Yaoqing — armed forces mainly comprised by foxians — the army of abominations made up of borisin and the like has finally been routed, with their numbers now on the decline.[5] The Yaoqing also employ Shadow Guards for reconnaissance, intelligence gathering, and wetwork.[6] Vidyadhara cloudhymn magi of the Xianzhou Fanghu's Ebonpearl Fleet specialize in using cloudhymn magic in combat.[7] The Xianzhou Zhuming is known for it's artillery and Dawn Army deploy into battle with heliobi.[8] Cloud Knights may sometimes be deployed on secondment to the Ten-Lords Commission.[9]\nThere is a Cloud Knight saying; \"A Cloud Knight must never let slip their weapon, nor let slacken their form.\"[10] Luofu swordplay is all about swift and agile movements with an emphasis on footwork. Those with quick hands and a flexible body are a good fit to practice Luofu swordplay. Zhuming swordplay places and emphasis on strong, focused strikes, trying to take down targets with a single strike. Practicing Zhuming swordplay helps to develop strength.[11]\nCloud Knights use various weapons, namely devastator glaives, and other armaments such as thunder crossbows, recurve bows, rifles, shields, spears, guillotine blades, and swords. Cloud Knights may also use their own personal weapons like Sushang's Xuanyuan sword and Yunli's Old Mettle. General Feixiao uses both gun-blades and a battleaxe. Some Cloud Knights prefer to use flying swords connected into their spinal meridian from acupuncture points. They need only to think to move them around though they may be difficult to control. The Zhuming is known for it's use of artillery in combat, and have weapons of mass destruction like Zhuming Flames and Alchemical Arrows.[12] Starskiffs can also fire alchemical arrows.[13] During the High-Cloud Quintet era, Yingxing and Xianzhou military engineers who marched with the army adjusted and tested giant aurumatons that were hundreds of feet tall and were specialized weapons designed to counter borisin mechabeasts.[14]\nDespite their deceptively esoteric designs, the weapons of the Xianzhou are actually quite advanced. Their blades are high-frequency and monomolecular, their crossbows are electromagnetic and their recurve bows are thermal seeking.[15][16] The arrows of Yukong's bow are self-guided auto-aim ones, and drawing the bow is just used to give a sense of antiquity. Usually, Xianzhou swordsmiths infuse a basic level of awareness into their swords to make them easier to wield, like Yanqing's flying sword.[12][17] According to Howard, the Xianzhou Natives like using a few tricks to mask their strength, likely connected to their propensity for humility.[18] The Xianzhou Zhuming's Artisanship Commission is responsible for providing sixty or seventy percent of all of the Cloud Knights' armaments.[19]\nIt was rumored that military rations aboard the Yaoqing include dried mineshrooms from Thalassa, though this hasn't been verified.[20] When fighting the borisin, Cloud Knights either don breathing masks or take poison-proof pellets called Clear-Head Flowing-Meridian Infusion to resist the effects of Lupotoxin, suppressing the fear incited by the borisin's pheromones.[21] Some of the Cloud Knights use pellets which contain trace amounts of Yabruh to block pain on the battlefield.[22]\nThe Yaoqing briefly collaborated with the Intelligentsia Guild to create a medicinal pellet that could resist most of the Chiseltooth Pack's microbe weaponry. Soldiers are advised to bring at least two of these pellets or something similar before going to combat. The Yaoqing has also developed a tactic against the Sableclaw Pack's superior olfactory senses by deploying smell disruptors and counter pheromones. Before sent on deployment against borisin, it is recommended that Cloud Knights bring at least two units of counter-entrapment inhibitors known as \"Perfume.\"[23]\nThe Cloud Knights of the Zhuming's Dawn Army deploy into battle with heliobi. Even on the Zhuming, it's rare to see a soldier and a heliobus have a close symbiotic relationship. The connection between a person and a heliobus becomes unstable under immense pressure, and at times like this, military healers use incense to purge evil.[8][24]\nFighter starskiffs make up the bulk of the Cloud Knights air force. At least 500,000 fighter jets were deployed during the Third Abundance War. Large fighter starskiffs need to be operated in pairs. One pilot takes the helm, the other controls the turrets.[25] The Verdant Knights use starskiffs born with biotechnology instead of being grown from seeds. Newly born starskiffs are described as \"furry little creatures\" that may join the battlefield after growing in a few short months, becoming loyal partners capable of eradicating abominations.[4] The Navis Astriger is a type of Cloud Knight troop carrier starskiff that can land and deploy Cloud Knights onto the surface of a planet.[26] The Xianzhou Alliance also employs large military vessels like battleships that boast massive cannons.[27]\n"

        "url": "https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com//wiki/Reignbow_Arbiter",
        "content": "Lan (Chinese: 岚 Lán), also known as the Reignbow Arbiter (Chinese: 帝弓司命 Dìgōng Sīmìng) or god of the Skybow (Chinese: 天弓 Tiāngōng), is an Aeon in Honkai: Star Rail representing The Hunt.\nLan harbors an intense hatred towards Yaoshi the Abundance and the undead abominations created by THEM. THEY tirelessly hunt them down, driven by the devastation the Abundance caused on THEIR homeworld.[4]\nIn contrast with the other Aeons, Lan pays close attention to mortals.[5] THEY often appear before them, but move too fast to be seen, the only portents of THEIR presence being vestiges of the Lux Arrow tearing across the sky. THEIR first appearance was around Year 3400 of the Star Calendar with THEIR Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow severing the Abundance's Ambrosial Arbor.\nLan is described as a tall, valiant prince with a crown in the Simulated Universe. THEY possess centaur like features, taking form of a man combined with an equine below the waist, while the hind legs are replaced by wheels of a chariot.\nA Xianzhou origin myth found in the \"Ode to Reignbow Path\" describes the pre-ascended Reignbow Arbiter as an anonymous Xianzhou hero. This is believed to be historical truth by a minority of academics. However, there is no factual evidence to show that the hero is Lan. Although the Xianzhou Alliance has never outright denied the myth's authenticity, their unclear stance on the subject has been taken as an implicit denial.[6][7]\nThe Reignbow Arbiter was originally not a god, but a mortal born before the Three Sufferings era. Based on historical records, they were born in approximately 1700 Star Calendar.[8]\nAt some point in the past, they led the Xianzhou army against the Heliobi, who formed a red micro-star to capture the Xianzhou fleet. A suicide squad led by the Reignbow disassembled and weaponized the auxiliary engine of the Xianzhou Yaoqing, and sent straight into the the red star, causing the star to undergo early decay and implode into a black hole. After their victory, the Xianzhou army locked up the defeated Heliobi leader, the Flint Emperor, sentencing them to serve as the power source for the Xianzhou Zhuming for the rest of their eternal life.[8]\nThe planting of the Ambrosial Arbor on the Xianzhou Luofu brought celebration and joy for the immortality it promised. However, the Reignbow foresaw the devastation that mara would cause to the Xianzhou, possibly with the help of the Wisdomwalker. When they tried to warn the others of this future, they were mocked and labeled as insane. To show their resolve, they shot the Ambrosial Arbor — an act they would be convicted for. The aristocrats who had eaten the fruit of the Arbor were enraged, but as they still respected the Reignbow's heroic exploits and prestige, could only sentence them to continual hibernation in cryo-sleep pods.[8]\nDuring the \"Flaming Catastrophe,\" one of the Three Sufferings of the Era of Bloodshed, the Xianzhou Alliance encountered the tree-planet Muldrasil, which gravitated towards the Luofu's Arbor. War broke out between the Xianzhou and Muldrasil. Fatigued from their civil war between the coarse and the nobility, as well as the aurumaton rebellion, the Xianzhou decided to release all prisoners of the cryo-hibernation from their slumber to help them fight. Among the released prisoners was the Reignbow. Once awakened, they descended into the prison deep within the Zhuming and made a deal with the Flint Emperor, allowing them to possess their physical body in exchange for the power of Heliobi.[8]\nInspired by the Reignbow’s sacrifice, many Xianzhou residents made the same deal with heliobi and formed suicide squads to fight in the war against Muldrasil. The Reignbow took position from the bow of the Yaoqing and shot an arrow enhanced by the power of the Flint Emperor.[9] The force of their star-shattering shot was so great that it affected every ship of the Xianzhou Alliance, as \"blood rain poured upon the Xuling\" and \"nights turned crimson on the Fanghu.\" The arrow smashed into the Ambrosial Arbor and severed its connection to Muldrasil, greatly wounding the planet. This ripped open a fissure into the void and a monstrous wave of imaginary force spewed from it.[8]\nBased on historical records, the Reignbow disappeared after shooting that arrow, although the Flint Emperor had left behind part of their body.[8] It is believed that the Reignbow saved the battle at the cost of \"self-burning,\" and they ascended to Aeonhood after their death.[9]\nIn Year 3400, the Reignbow Arbiter appeared for the first time and severed the Ambrosial Arbor with THEIR Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow, saving the Xianzhou Luofu from the Muldrasil and the wingweavers.[1][7]\nIn Year 4100, the Reignbow Arbiter became the undisputed main Aeon of the Xianzhou Alliance, displacing the Xianzhou's previous worship of Qlipoth.[10]\nIn Year 7900, the Yuque's Cloudpeer Telescope managed to detect Reignbow's manifestation. Trace elements pointed to three coordinates in the Consternation Starzone: The Yadav variable star; the Cerulean Nightmare; and the Knucklebone. Using the Matrix of Prescience, the master diviner predicted that it must have been plagued.[11]\nIn Year 7954, the Cloudpeer Telescope managed to detect traces of Reignbow's Lux Arrow nearby Laevateinn-XVI. When the Cloud Knights' Vernalbolt Fleet arrived at the coordinates, the planet had been destroyed without any survivors remaining. It was categorized as a \"deadworld,\" and deleted from the astral charts.[11]\nIn Year 8072, during the Third Abundance War, Fu Xuan came up with a plan to ship the Cloudpeer Telescope to the Xianzhou Fanghu, which had fallen victim to a surprise attack from the Denizens of Abundance. Jingtian, former Master Diviner of the Yuque's Divination Commission and the only person who had the permission to use the telescope, sent out an SOS signal to the last observed location of the Reignbow's Lux Arrow.[12] Yueyu, former Arbiter-General of the Yaoqing, defended the telescope till her last moment.[13] The Reignbow descended onto the battlefield and fired THEIR Lux Arrow, annihilating the borisins' fleet and turning the tide of the battle. However, the supreme destructive force of THEIR divine arrow destroyed nearly one-fifth of the Xianzhou Fanghu's delves.[11] Within these delves was the field hospital Yufei, an Alchemy Commission healer, was stationed at.[14]\nIn AE 2131, the astronomical observation system detected a spacial disturbance left by an entity traveling too fast to be measured. Shortly thereafter, a flash of light cleaved apart the sky, leaving behind abnormal rainbow-colored traces. Half a unit of system time later, the entirety of the planet Xuange imploded. Xuange's inhabitants were affected by the molting disease and the planet's destruction was attributed to the Hunt.[15]\nAt some point of AE 2158 (Star Calendar Year 8100[16]) during the Luminary Wardance Ceremony on the Luofu, when Feixiao confronted Hoolay in Inner Beast's Battlefield, they debated on the reason they fight knowing that Aeons never answer the mortals. She answered that she fights so that one day she will never have to witness another Lux Arrow falling to the ground and so that just one more person can live and return to the Yaoqing alongside her. She prayed that the arrows of The Hunt will pierce the heart of every monster even if Lan does not respond to her. As Lan witnessed her determination, THEY gazed at her and sent her axe to the battlefield like a shooting star.[17]\nThe Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow is a projectile weapon shot by Lan that can shatter stars light-years away. Shards of the Lux Arrow can be reforged by the Furnace Master, chief of the Xianzhou artisans, for those who are worthy.[18] At the end of the Third Denizens of Abundance War, the Reignbow Arbiter's Sky-Shattering Lux Arrow wiped out everything along the way. The Xianzhou people used the burning embers of the arrow to create many divine objects.[19] The Lux Arrow is the only known material that can harm the Ambrosial Arbor.[20] The arrows are made with stars and shot with gravity.[21]\nAlthough the Simulated Universe Index says that Lan often appears before mortals, Fu Xuan says that THEY rarely appear before mortals and \"the only portents of THEIR presence are vestiges of the Lux Arrow tearing across the sky.\"[1] The Record of Reignbow's Road says that \"Reignbow would never speak to any mortal... THEY only let their Lux Arrow do all the talking.\"[11] According to Welt, Lan does not rank among the more powerful Aeons as THEIR path is very narrow, but THEY pay close attention to mortals. THEY grant strength to the Xianzhou Alliance without reservation, allowing their marshal and six generals to stand on par with the Lord Ravagers, Emanators of Nanook the Destruction.[5]\nEach of the seven Arbiter-Generals possesses a Spiritus (Chinese: 威灵) granted to them by Lan.[22]\nThe Lightning-Lord (Chinese: 神君), full name Lightning-Wielding Thunder-Clapping Spirit-Squashing Lord (Chinese: 神霄雷府总司驱雷掣电追魔扫秽天君),[23] is the Spiritus granted by Lan to the Arbiter-General of the Luofu, and it is described as enveloped in golden lightning.[24] Currently Jing Yuan commands the Lightning-Lord and it was previously wielded by Teng Xiao.[25][26]\nFlying Aureus (Chinese: 飞黄) is the Spiritus bestowed upon the General of the Yaoqing, its speed is the greatest out of the seven spirits manifestated by Lan and it is used as the symbol of the Verdant Knights.[27][28] Currently Feixiao commands Flying Aureus and it was presumably previously wielded by Yueyu.[29]\nWhen Lan appears in the Simulated Universe, the following sound will play: ▶\n...Lan, on the other hand, often appears before mortals. However, THEY move too fast, and very few observations have been made about THEIR actual form. Most of the reliable information is kept by the Xianzhou Alliance and it took me a great amount of effort to get. As one of the rare factions in the universe that is completely blessed by an Aeon, the Alliance stands on equal grounds with the IPC, which meant the IPC couldn't help me at all. In the end, Ruan Mei had to step up to help. In the ancient Xianzhou language, \"Lan\" means \"an unpredictable fog,\" and the Aeon's formal name in Xianzhou is Reignbow Arbiter. According to Xianzhou natives, the Lux Arrow of The Hunt showed them the way as their civilization was about to fall...\n...How would you describe the Aeon of The Hunt? We can get an impression from the Xuange Observation Station's report in AE 2131. The astronomical observation system detected a gravitational wave, a spatial disturbance left by an entity traveling too fast to be measured and covering astronomical distances. Shortly thereafter, a flash of light cleaved apart the sky, leaving behind abnormal rainbow-colored traces. Half a unit of system time later, the entirety of the planet Xuange imploded. The bad news was the IPC lost a planet in its business sphere. The good news was the IPC was out of ideas regarding the molting disease (undoubtedly the work of Yaoshi) spreading throughout Xuange. The light permanently \"healed\" that planet and the patients on it, a race of immortal half-human half-snake monsters. This is the action and creed of The Hunt, for whom salvation and destruction are nigh indistinguishable. Their perpetual enemy, the Abundance, is the same, for THEY bring healing and torment hand-in-hand...\n"

The Divination Commission is responsible for gathering intelligence, devising strategies, and performing divination, as well as predicting the fortune of future events. The Xianzhou Luofu's Divination Commission, helmed by Master Diviner Fu Xuan, reviews every decision made on the Luofu, including the areas of navigation, governance, and military and civil affairs.\nThe Xianzhou Yuque was the birthplace of the Divination Commission, where the stargazers and diviners gathered to observe the stars and plot the path ahead for the Alliance.[1] The Commission uses powerful devices such as the Yuque's Deca-Light Reflection Barrier Matrix and the Luofu's Matrix of Prescience Ultima to draw information from the past and predict the future by interpreting hexagrams,[2] along with the Yuque's Cloudpeer Telescope, the ultimate astronomical observation device in the Alliance that can detect traces and signals of the Reignbow Arbiter's Lux Arrow and manifestations in the Alliance. Not only can it scry into the distance, but it can also be used to send out information.[3] One of the Divination Commission's unwritten rules are the \"three taboos\" — \"No insincere divination, no unjust divination, and no unpracticed divination.\"[4][5]\nThe Divination Commission was founded by Grandmaster Xuan Yao on the Xianzhou Yuque. Stargazers of the Yuque once produced 152 consecutive years' worth of observational records about the dead planet Syracuse-III and watched as the Antimatter Legion crept very slowly toward this front line, building up an advantage, exerting pressure, and chipping away at any resistance. They speculated that behind the scenes lay an Overlord with a calm and self-sufficient temperament. Based on IPC records, at least 122 planets were plunged into chaos of unknown origin over the past 600 years before their ultimate demise at the hands of the Antimatter Legion. The Yuque's Divination Commission attributed these series of events to another unseen Lord Ravager. The Yuque's Divination Commission observed the destruction of Muldrasil around the year 5320 Star Calendar. The Antimatter Legion destroyed the wingweavers' home almost instantly. According to the speculations of the Yuque's Divination Commission, there may be other worlds like Muldrasil.[6]\nDuring an unnamed conflict on Thalassa, the Yuque's Echojade Fleet laid out a defense in coordination with the Yaoqing's encirclement and eradication of abominations. The Yuque's Master Diviner, Jingtian, determined the outcome of the battle and relayed it to the Arbiter-Generals, who in turn deployed Heroncrest Fleet of the Yaoqing instead of the Fanghu. Though the Fanghu's Ebonpearl Fleet could have stopped the abominations with their Vidyadhara cloudhymn magic, they were too far away, and current forces on the battlefield would have had to withstand multiple counterattacks from the enemy for six months before Fanghu reinforcements arrived. They pressed a strong offense for some time, but lost any hope of success thereafter due to the Devil Tide of Thalassa.[7]\nIn the year 8072 Star Calendar, during the Third Abundance War, the Yaoqing and Fanghu alerted the Xianzhou Luofu about the assembly of the Denizens of Abundance, the revival of the living planet Ketu Mirage, and their attack on the Fanghu. The Luofu dispatched four brigades of Cloud Knights to help them fight, but they were still in a dire situation. Diviner Fu Xuan of the Luofu proposed a plan to the Six Charioteers to contact the Reignbow Arbiter using the Yuque's Cloudpeer Telescope, which would be shipped to the Fanghu using a Navis Astriger. The Yuque's Master Diviner, Jingtian, was the only person who had the permission to use the Cloudpeer Telescope and could send out a signal in the format of the Reignbow's decree. The Reignbow Arbiter then descended onto the battlefield and annihilated the borisin fleet using THEIR Lux Arrow, and nearly one-fifth of the Xianzhou Fanghu's delves were destroyed by the Lux Arrow's bombardment. Master Diviner Jingtian perished in the collateral destruction.[8][3]\nOn July, Year 8098 Star Calendar, the Yuque reported continuing their explorations along an ancient shipping lane.[9] Sometime in the present, the Xianzhou Yuque was trekking around the periphery of the Giant's Arm star cluster, plotting an ancient course as it continued its explorations. The ship's Cloudpeer Telescope captured signals from Reignbow's Lux Arrow traversing through three of its coordinates. The Master Diviner interpreted this as a divine mandate, and the Marshal issued orders for the Xianzhou Yaoqing Cloud Knights' Heroncrest Fleet and Red Ballad Fleet to both set out on patrol as hereby informed. In their recent observations, the Yuque Divination Commission reported that the Brood Lord Angqin lead his hunting pack against the Shepherds fleet near the Echidna skywall in an internal war between the borisin. They also learned from the IPC's data that the wingweavers' Peacock Angel legion had arrived at the Consternation Starzone to locate a Stellaron and revive their homeworld of Muldrasil. They also observed that the Baranza Forge, an industrial planet along the Luofu's route, had been completely neutralized by the Lord Ravager Irontomb's assault, deeming it a medium-low threat to the Luofu and advised its Divination Commission to monitor electrical signals from Irontomb's vehicle.[10]\nSometime in the Year 8100 Star Calendar, a Stellaron was smuggled onboard the Luofu and shortly afterwards, a Stellaron Burst occurred. The Stellaron Hunters, Blade and Kafka, were suspected to be behind the incident. General Jing Yuan enlisted the help of the Astral Express Crew to find Kafka and bring her in and when they confronted her, Luofu Master Diviner Fu Xuan intervened to make the arrest. The group made their way to Exalting Sanctum as the Meridian Pin at the Divination Commission was malfunctioning due to the Stellaron Burst. Diviner and Repository Librarian Qingque then escorted the Express Crew to the Divination Commission where Fu Xuan had already brought Kafka. The Master Diviner then began her interrogation of Kafka via the Matrix of Prescience Ultima while the Express Crew listened in, as per their agreement with General Jing Yuan. While relaying the results of her interrogation to Jing Yuan, Kafka managed to escape with the help of Blade and the Ambrosial Arbor's revival as a distraction.[11]\nAfter the rebirth of Ambrosial Arbor, Master Diviner Fu Xuan was ordered to perform divination for the Ten-Lords Commission, with Judge Xueyi providing the dossier to do so, though the former claimed that it was not enough information. Xueyi then tasked the Trailblazer with apprehending wanted fugitives from the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus in Stargazer Navalia in order to use them as clues to hunt down the other disciples using the Matrix of Prescience. In return, she summoned Master Ryan from the Hall of Karma into an aurumaton in order for Chengjie to speak with him.[12] Sometime after the crisis, Jingliu and Luocha, who were suspected to have smuggled the Stellaron, were to be sent to the Xianzhou Xuling to be held for a joint trial before the Ten-Lords Commission and the Seven Arbiter-Generals according to protocol. However, after General Jing Yuan reported the events to Marshal Hua, General Yaoguang took an interest in their case, and had the Deca-Light Reflection Barrier set up, detouring the two to the Xianzhou Yuque.[13]\nMaster Diviner Fu Xuan had also been summoned to the Yuque for questioning and to meet General Yaoguang.[14] Lingsha, the newly appointed Cauldron Master of the Luofu Alchemy Commission, ordered the forbidden books confiscated by the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus to be brought to the Divination Commission repository for sealing as soon she started her position.[15]\n"

        "session_name": "Vidyadhara",
        "url": "https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com//wiki/Vidyadhara",
        "content": "A Vidyadhara's most telling and distinctive feature is their pointed, sharp ears. A long-life species, Vidyadhara molt after living for six or seven hundred years, repairing their bodies, then hatching anew from pearl-like eggs with their past memories gone. Powdered hatching rebirth eggshells can be used for medicinal purposes.[1] Injuries may also prematurely trigger the process of hatching rebirth. Vidyadhara typically go to Scalegorge Waterscape for the self-reincarnating process.[2][3] There, Vidyadhara Pearlkeepers will assist and protect their newly-reborn kin.[4] Pearlkeeper teams may have members that specialize in combat, cloudhymn, and egg-nurturing. The Xianzhou Fanghu occasionally sends inspectors to check on the condition of Scalegorge Waterscape.[5] Once born, a teacher is assigned to instruct young Vidyadhara in the art of cloudhymn and various life skills.[6]\nThere may be certain disorders or diseases that affect the hatching rebirth cycle, such as Jinyu's condition, which causes her growth to be a hundred times faster than a normal Vidyadhara and undergoes her cycle of hatching rebirth every few months. Bailu states that this is an extremely rare, one-in-a-million condition that she is unfortunately unable to treat.[7] Another such condition is Everdream Syndrome, which is caused by inefficient energy conversion during the hatching rebirth period. This syndrome once caused a female Vidyadhara patient to enter a comatose state for 100 to 150 years after her hatching rebirth, requiring her to take lifelong qi-supplementing medication. Only upon her next hatching rebirth could the results of the treatment be observed.[8] The actor Shiyun mentions being unable to grow past a child form, possibly meaning he possesses a similar, though inverted, condition to Jinyu.\nIt is possible that Vidyadhara may be born any sex regardless of whether their previous incarnation was male or female.[5] Vidyadhara are unable to have offspring, and therefore any Vidyadhara deaths lead to a permanent decrease in their overall population, which they take very seriously.[9] However, this also means the Sky-Faring Commission's travel reviewers are fairly lenient on them, which allows Vidyadhara many opportunities to travel to other worlds compared to the other two long-life races, as they cannot uncontrollably propagate like Xianzhou Natives and Foxians might.[10] Their life cycle relies upon continuous cellular transdifferentiation. This is the reason why Vidyadharas do not face the ailments of immortality, namely mara, that many other long-life species have to contend with.[11]\nSome Vidyadhara like Ling Jie or the Sad Woman leave diaries, information, or heirlooms for their next incarnations to inherit, while others like Jinyu prefer not to. Vidyadhara who wish to leave personal belongings for their next incarnation can do so with hatching rebirth managers like Lingling. However, many newly reborn Vidyadhara are unable to identify sentimental items belonging to their past selves, and any discarded items are often resold as trinkets.[12]\nThe Vidyadhara are capable of an art known as cloudhymn magic or cloudcry magic, which takes painstaking practice to use, though High Elders have a notable talent for it, with the Imbibitor Lunae being able to create tidal waves, water spouts, rain, water spears, and even parting the seas at Scalegorge Waterscape on several occasions.[13][14] It appears to be hydrokinetic in nature on the Luofu and Fanghu and has multiple applications. Cloudhymn can be used in acrobatic performance art, but has little astonishing effect on crowds, as these tricks are known to be endemic to the Vidyadhara.[15] It also has practical combat applications, and a number of Vidyadhara are trained in it, especially Pearlkeepers and Cloudhymn Magi.[16] It is implied that cloudhymn magi from the Fanghu's Ebonpearl Fleet would have been sufficient to stop Thalassa's Devil Tide.[17]\nCloudhymn magic can be used to create illusions through optical refraction, and make the user and their surroundings practically invisible.[5] Counter to this, mirage echolocation can be used to detect such illusions by centering and transmitting mirage echoes. Mirage echoes are memories of past lives and echoes of the past that Vidyadhara shed during their rebirth. They can be conversed with, though they tend to only talk to people they recognize. It is said that the water on their bodies can be used as medicine. Cloudhymn can also be used to heal, as demonstrated by Dan Feng and Bailu.[6] Other applications of cloudhymn also include the ability to float and project holographic images.[18] Cloudhymn magic can also be applied industrially to mechanisms such as the elixir crucibles.[19]\nOn the Xianzhou Yaoqing, Vidyadhara Windsayers have laid a \"Feather Path\" in the Caelorum Venti Pavilion that links 16 floating islands together to allow people to walk freely in the air without any flying or floating equipment.[18] The Wind Mantle technique used by the Vidyadhara serving Caelorum Venti also allow the user to turn invisible.[20]\nThe power to turn into dragons was a rare inheritance passed down only to those who could successfully complete numerous rites and challenges. Those that do develop more draconic features such as horns and a tail, and are generally referred to as High Elders.[2] Young High Elders are guided, advised, and educated by Preceptors.[21] At some point in their lives, High Elders will receive the \"Orb of Abysm\" and the \"Transmutation Arcanum,\" which should enable them to re-experience the events of their dragon ancestors' lives in dreams. The Office of Deep Sources is charged with transcribing, retelling, and annotating these dreams, and their files run to an enormous number of volumes. Although such dreams tend to be fragmentary and difficult to understand or interpret, it is the only way the Vidyadhara believe they have of coming close to the Permanence.[21] To take the throne, the High Elder of the Vidyadhara needs to pass a series of trials during which their physical features slowly transform to resemble that of their predecessors.[22]\nThe Transmutation Arcanum is said to contain a secret that allows the Vidyadhara to escape the cycle of reincarnation and return to normal reproduction, but the mechanism to this is unknown. The secret of Vidyadhara reproduction may entail the incorporation of other races into their species.[6]\nIt was once believed that all Vidyadhara had the power of transmutation gifted to them by Long to change the form of any creature as easily as children playing with modeling clay; for example, if a sea beast was too small to be eaten, they'd fatten it up and make it proliferate. However, they eventually lost this ability, and the other species in their homeworld turned hostile against them and they were forced to flee.[23] The Vidyadhara are also said to have always observed the law of natural flow. They believe all creatures are connected to one another, and that life is everlasting in its cycle.[10]\nThe individual Vidyadhara population on each Xianzhou ship is lead by a respective High Elder who is responsible for the wellbeing of their people.[9][24] In the case where the High Elder cannot lead, the Council of Preceptors assumes governance in their place.[25] The High Elder has the power to affect Preceptor assignments. Likewise, the Preceptors have the power to strip the current High Elder of their name and power and elect a new one in their place should the circumstances deem fit to do so.[26][5] The High Elder selection tradition had already existed before the Vidyadhara migrated to the Xianzhou.[27]\nThe Xianzhou Fanghu is an autonomous dominion of the Vidyadhara, and thusly has different customs, culture, and social structures from other Xianzhou ships.[2] Glaciator Marum, High Elder of the Fanghu, governs over all citizens, and the Six Charioteers and Six Commissions support the High Elder. It is because of their influence that the Pearlkeepers aboard the Fanghu formed an elite force that have basically replaced the role of the Cloud Knights there. Pearlkeepers are trained in cloudhymn and combat, their signature weapons being tidal tridents.[28] Vidyadhara on the Fanghu enjoy a number of welfare benefits compared to other Xianzhou ships. For example, on the Fanghu, upon completing their hatching rebirth, the newborn Vidyadhara is immediately assigned a new residence without having to go through the standard real estate paperwork, which is an inconvenience to Vidyadhara who cannot keep track of their past lives. Additionally, it is said the water quality on the Fanghu is better than other Xianzhou ships.[29]\nThe Vidyadhara have made great advancements in medicine. Liu Hua, a Vidyadhara Pearlkeeper that supported Glaciator Marum for the first three hundred years of his life and became the head healer that closely served him for the last four hundred, wrote a book that is widely recognized as the foundation of the Xianzhou Alliance's modern medicine. Through his long years of clinical practice and research, Liu Hua had acutely realized the Xianzhou medical science's problem at that time: the Xianzhou's tradition of preserving the past meant significant amounts of medical practice relied on experience instead of science. Liu Hua therefore authored Liu Hua's Medical Compendium in the hopes of re-organizing and better explaining the principles of Xianzhou medical science using more scientific methods of inquiry.[30] Specially-made Vidyadhara medicine or medicinal herbs can be found in Scalegorge Waterscape or the Alchemy Commissions, which include Draconic Tears, Tian Dong, Dragon Scale Coral, and cyan poria. The Alchemy Commissions of the Luofu and Fanghu have a Dragon Tree and Dragon Scale Coral Statue respectively, symbolizing the Vidyadhara's deep connection with Xianzhou medical practices.\n\"Injection of Past Life in Dreams\" is a Vidyadhara prescription that, when ingested after their hatching rebirth, allows Vidyadhara to remember their past life. Clinical evidence shows this prescription should be used within the first five years after hatching rebirth. Administered via golden needle injection, the patient will be able to regain memories of their previous life via dreams. However, the quantity and level of clarity of these memories are unable to be controlled. According to Vidyadhara legends, this prescription was made by the alchemist Qinglu for their lover. Qinglu did not want their relationship to be over and wanted to continue it in their next reincarnation. This prescription goes against the cultural traditions and laws of the Vidyadhara, and was deemed not be used except when the very survival of the Vidyadhara race is at risk. It is an offense against the laws of the Vidyadhara to use the injection of past life in dreams on a Vidyadhara against their will, through coercion, or by force. Any offenders would suffer the punishment of forced rebirth.\n\"The General's Di Huang Drink\" is a medicinal pellet for Vidyadhara that do not grow past their infantile stage and suffer from delayed development. This medication is still under clinical trial. If no results emerge after a year, the prescription is to be considered invalid and abandoned. One of the ingredients, Bigger-Faster, is a combination medication from various different plants. Though there are no toxic side effects, it is strictly forbidden to widely apply this medication before Lady Bailu confirms its efficacy.[31] Longevity Hall is an apothecary owned by Little Tian that sells medicines licensed by the Alchemy Commission.[32]\nWhile the Vidyadhara are known for their unique medical treatment that can only be provided by their race,[33] they also appear to have very capable craftsmen. Cloud Knight Lieutenant Yanqing once asked the Trailblazer to help him decide between purchasing two swords from the Artisanship Commission, one of them of Vidyadhara make, forged with the exotic corallium metal of Scalegorge Waterscape and tempered with thaumaspring water.[34] The Passerby's Roaming Dragon Bracers were made from flowing coral gold and the leather of unknown beasts, and it was said that only master artisans from the Vidyadhara dragon race could create this kind of superior armor.[35]\nYunyou, attendant to the young High Elder, Bailu, commissioned some of the finest craftsmen to create the Dragonhorn Pilory to shackle the latter's tail in order to prevent a loss of control over her powers.[21] Dracocatena Nails being staked into his body and chains of corallium were used to contain Dan Feng, Imbibitor Lunae of the Luofu, inside the Shackling Prison.[36] Ardens Regia, the High Elder of the Xianzhou Zhuming, once sent a Vidyadhara craftsman to the Luofu to teach the masters of the Luofu Artisanship Commission about craftsmanship. The craftsman then started their hatching rebirth with the intent to pass back their improved knowledge back to the Zhuming after their rebirth.[5]\nPrime examples of Vidyadhara architecture include Scalegorge Waterscape and the Luofu Shackling Prison, which saw Vidyadhara Ichor Line craftsmen introduce the ingenuity of delve enchantment into the prison's design.[37]  It took the Artisanship Commission of the Yaoqing and 3,000 Vidyadhara craftsmen more than 20 years to build the Caelorum Venti Pavilion with large slabs of jade and moonstone. It is hailed as the epitome of the Yaoqing Vidyadhara architectural style.[18]\nVidyadhara elegies are the traditional music of the Vidyadhara people. The Vidyadhara use only simple castanets for musical instruments, relying on extremely diverse sets of melodies. Originating from their folk songs, the style is generally that of mournful dirges. Vidyadhara elegies can be said to represent all of the most tragic aspects of Xianzhou culture, as Vidyadhara players tend to sing about loves lost and pyrrhic victories.[38] Vidyadhara elegies suit a tragic tone, and they only have a handful of happy endings, as they originate from an era of great unrest and turmoil for them. Most performances leave listeners with a bitter-sweet taste. Several hundred years ago, there was a Vidyadhara player named Ling Jie who sang two operas which went sensationally viral aboard the Xianzhou Luofu: \"Dragontooth Tales\" and \"Fateful Rebirth.\"[39]\nThe Vidyadhara also have a presence in the immersia industry. Yong Zheng, a Vidyadhara, was known as one of the greatest directors in the history of Butterfly Immersia with his well-known immersias being: Deep Water, Luofu Monster, Heliobus Ingenia, and Xianzhou Predator. He was said to be one of the pioneers of the evil beast genre. All of Yong Zheng's works in his creative career are from a Vidyadhara's perspective.[4]\nAs for cuisine, there are a few Vidyadhara-owned restaurants: Dragon Palace's Kitchen on the Xianzhou Zhuming, and Spices Supreme and Delicacy Pavilion on the Xianzhou Luofu. The former is the only Interastral Gourmet Association-rated five star restaurant among the Xianzhou ships, and is known for being expensive while serving small portions. However, Spices Supreme was opened with the opposite dining philosophy in mind, serving big portions with quality food, and at low prices.[10] Delicacy Pavilion is another established Vidyadhara-owned restaurant in Aurum Alley on the Luofu.[40]\n4 Characters match the category selection:\nThere are 31 additional Vidyadhara NPCs:\nThere are 4 Vidyadhara mentioned characters:\nThere are no upcoming Vidyadhara NPCs.\n"

        "session_name": "Foxians",
        "url": "https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com//wiki/Foxian",
        "content": "Foxians are identifiable by their fox-like ears protruding from atop their heads. Most Foxians have fluffy tails of varying thickness while a few like Yuan and Feixiao have none. Yuan considers this a genetic disadvantage though it doesn't affect their daily lives.[2] Foxians are said to be synonymous with the quick and the agile. They have lightning-fast reflexes and keen senses, and juvenile Foxians often have cheeky, playful personalities.[3] Despite lacking the Borisin's constant mutating and transforming bodies, they possess keen adaptability and wit.[4] Foxians can pick up the scent of borisins from extensive distances.[5][6]\nFoxians have a lifespan of 250-450 years. The median age of natural death for Foxians is 307 years, making them relatively short-lived compared to the other species that inhabit the Xianzhou. Similar to canids, chocolate is toxic to Foxians and will make them sick should they consume it.[7][8]\nDuring the vast majority of a Foxian's life, a large number of all-powerful stem cells are stored in numerous organs of their body. These all-powerful stem cells will continuously repair the physical body of Foxians, allowing aging and damage to be healed in a short period of time. Until a few years before their end of life, the number of these all-powerful stem cells gradually decreases, but still remains sufficient to maintain their ageless appearance. Between 250 to 450 years, the median age being 307 years, these all-powerful stem cells come to a complete halt and lose their ability to divide freely.[7]\nWhat ensues is a death that comes with multiple organ failure. Natural death comes quickly, with patients often dying within 3 to 4 days after the all-powerful stem cells have lost their ability to divide. The good thing is that most Foxians are prepared for the various age-related diseases that begin to develop in their organs, so it is typically not too late to prepare for the aftermath. Although Foxians typically do not succumb to mara because of their shorter lifespans, they are still susceptible to it through unnatural means, such as the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus' medicinal pellets.[9][7]\nFoxian pheromones can be used to create controllable illusions in Butterfly Immersia and is the base of Foxian magic,[10] and Butterfly Immersia is even said to be a cultural relic of Xianzhou Foxians.[11]\nSome Foxians are susceptible to the affliction known as \"Moon Rage\", a phenomenon more typically seen in the borisin (whom the Foxians share a common ancestry with). Moon Rage is typically very rare in Foxians; the exception to this is the Foxians of the Xianzhou Yaoqing, where it is more common due to them being more genetically similar to the borisin than the average Foxian. The Verdant Knights of the Yaoqing often rescue Foxian slaves from worlds ruled by the borisin, and these rescuees often have more borisin ancestry than most Foxians, occasionally producing individuals exhibiting atavistic mutations. Although the borisin's Foxian war slaves possess strength and speed comparable to the borisin, their mutations also deplete their life and sanity.[12] Their bones and muscles undergo explosive reformation and growth, granting them incredible strength, but they lose their rationality, and fall into uncontrollable fury and insanity.[13][14][15]\nDespite their phylogenetic relationship with borisins, when the entire liver of a Foxian is completely removed, there has never been a record of a Foxian turning into a \"cancerous mass\" as is the case with borisin. Foxian stem cells are not generated in the liver, but gather there for some reason, and their regeneration rate slows down if the liver is removed.[7] The wingweaver Xili implied that the Zhuming Foxians look similar to borisin.[16] A Foxian that took pills from a Disciples of Sanctus Medicus transformed into a werewolf before being apprehended by Xueyi.[17]\nAccording to the Foxian \"birthfate\" custom of having babies \"picking\" their future, parents will put various objects and toys around an infant cub, and get them to choose their future career path by grabbing an item.[18] If the child reaches for a jade abacus, it is said they will grow up to be a diviner. If they reach for a sword, they will grow up to be a famous warrior, and if they reach for a toy starskiff, they'll become a starskiff pilot. After completing a custom known as the Hairpin Ceremony, Foxians may be considered adults.[19]\nPeople tend to hold a common belief that Foxians are naturals when it comes to business, though some people like Mengming say that business success results from practice rather than inborn talent. Most Foxian traders learn their skills by having their parents or superior leaving the business to them for a period of time as a test. They may ask someone they know to help out from behind the scenes and offer guidance.[20] Foxians have antique folk statuette that are said to bring wealth if placed correctly.[21] This may be similar to the real-life practice of feng shui.\nThe Foxians of the Xianzhou Yaoqing are known for their adventuring flying families. The most renowned of these families was that of Baiheng's.[22] Foxians from the Sky-Faring Commission have a tendency to refer to guests and clients as \"benefactors.\"[23][19] Even though Foxians are also considered a long-life species, their lives span only around three centuries. Therefore, many of them are more passionate about enjoying the fun in life and chasing the best moments in life with all their heart and soul.[24]\nFoxian soldiers have a ceremony where they place their dead in Starskiffs and then let them drift out into the stars, which is known as \"the Returning.\"[25] This rite is similar to the soul-soothing ceremony for other Xianzhou inhabitants. Given their limited lifespans, the only ones who place value on such funerary ceremonies are Foxians. Paper kites are often gifted to children, but as a symbol of spreading one's wings and soaring high up into the sky, they are also a comfort to Foxian pilots. Foxians have an old tradition where paper kites are used to comfort the souls of pilots who can no longer fly, which is still carried on to this day.[21]\nFoxian drum chanting is the youngest out of all the Xianzhou regional folk arts. Its origins can be traced back to the first Foxian merchants banging on pots and hawking goods out on the street, when Foxians first joined the Xianzhou Alliance. Performers strike drums while singing with the rhythm. It is almost exclusively a singing art, with almost no spoken word.[26] Foxian drum chanting themes closely align with the ethnic characteristics of the Foxians, who praise heroes and romance while singing of passionate battles and ardent emotion. However, compared with the simplicity of Xianzhou Chordophone, Foxian drum chanters usually adopt serenely beautiful and boundlessly evocative lyrics. One of the earliest Foxian drum chanting songs is the Foxian traditional \"Epic of the Old Verdant Home.\" In recent years, two Foxian drum chants have become quite popular: The \"Cloud Knights Against the borisin\" with its depiction of historical heroes, and the soft, joyful romance of \"Foxian Bewitched.\" Another one is \"Lament of the Six Follies\".[26]\nFoxian epics tell how the Foxian and Borisin races were divinely inspired by a Lord of Longevity from beyond the stars. Drinking from the Redspring, they were granted immortality. Despite their common origin, later historical developments saw the borisin treat the Foxians as slaves or cannon fodder, fueling their desire to conquer the stars.[13]\nPacify Play is a traditional theater performance of the Yaoqing Foxians. The theater's stage is described as vast and circular. The most authentic and traditional \"Pacify Play\" on Baiheng Street is available at Red Fox Theater. They need a large stage to be able to showcase all elements of the play, as the Red Fox Theater is one of the few that rejects the use of special effects to preserve their millennium-old traditions. This type of traditional opera uses different types of facial makeup to differentiate the characters and their personalities, so it requires some prior knowledge to be able to understand the story. Still, it is said that most people should have no problem experiencing the charm of the play, as it boasts super-realistic stage combat scenes where dozens of actors will find themselves moving around in midair, or acting out gunfights and physical struggles.[27]\nThe Verdant Knights' porcelain armor forged by Foxians was said to be as light as the wind and strong as steel that could withstand the borisin's claws and biotech weapons. The eagle helmet of the Verdant Knights, modeled after the ferocious bird \"Dafeng\", had two pairs of auxiliary eyes, ensuring clear vision of their surroundings under any lighting conditions. The armor had bionic gauntlet integrated with the body and combat boots fashioned after talons that allow the wearer to swiftly dash onto the battlefield like the wind, effortlessly traversing through thorns and rugged terrain.[28][4][29][30]\nAfter the Foxians joined the Xianzhou Alliance, many of them who wished to rebuild their homeland formed the Verdantia Sect, which merged with the Homeward Sect. Till this day, they remain a political force to be reckoned with. From the merging of the two sects, it is observed that their style of faith stands as something akin to a slogan for the Homeward Sect, as well as the Verdantia Sect. All they want is to be back in their homeland, Verdantia.[31]\nThe confinement of Hoolay, the borisin Warhead accountable for numerous acts of invasions, associated war crimes, and for long-term enslavement of Foxians and utilizing their blood for alchemical purposes, is the foundation of the alliance between the Xianzhou and the Foxians. Any individuals objecting to this sentence would be punished for \"Sowing Discord\".[32]\nA unique outlier and exception to the Foxians of the Xianzhou and Borisin packs is the Whitewolf Pack; it is not led by borisin, but instead by Foxians. Following Hoolay's capture, the resulting political instability caused the Foxian slaves they kept to rebel, with one notable Foxian, the \"Whitewolf Khan,\" slew their borisin master and took control of the planet the pack was on. The borisin were unable to quash the rebellion, though it is implied that the borisin eventually accepted them into their society. These foxians are performative zealots, not wanting to return to their enslaved fates and are enemies of the Xianzhou Alliance. Due to their affiliations with the borisin, the Yaoqing Cloud Knights often perform psychological screening on their own Foxian soldiers to prevent infiltration.[33]\nBoth the foxians and borisins came from Verdantia, the \"Planet of Verdant\". The foxians inhabited the riverlands while the borisins were herders who inhabited the grasslands. The foxians saw the borisins as savage while the borisins saw the foxians as deceptive merchants. Despite their animosity, they cooperated with each other during the extreme climates of the \"Vulpesummer\" and \"Lupuswinter\". In the summer, they would set down their weapons for the rich harvests, but during the winter there would be unceasing conflict due to hunger.[34]\nOne Lupuswinter lasted far longer than usual, causing mass starvation.

        "content": "Verdantia consists of the riverlands, inhabited by the foxians, and the grasslands, inhabited by borisins herders. The planet had extreme seasons known as the \"Vulpesummer\" and \"Lupuswinter.\"[1] Verdantia rice is still used by the Xianzhou Alliance, likely brought over by the foxians during their exodus.[2] Verdantia tongue was a common language understood by both foxians and borisin. Verdantia has a traditional fable of the \"Wolf God and Deer God\" that espouses balance between the Abundance and The Hunt.[3]\nEventually Yaoshi brought forth the Redspring, which transformed the planet and made it experience a population explosion and ecological collapse. With the Redspring as a medium, everything that the borisin needed was made from this miraculous source. The fields no longer grew grain but viscorpi instead, and borisin garments were no longer of linen or fabric but of embryonic flesh. Even the chilly snowlands that once terrified Verdantia civilizations were no longer a concern, for the borisin cultivated biological membranes in the polar regions to craft into warm dome-shaped tents, blocking the Lupuswinter beyond this barrier.[4]\nBoth the foxians and borisins originated from Verdantia. The foxians inhabited the riverlands, while the borisins were herders who inhabited the grasslands. The foxians saw the borisins as savage while the borisins saw the foxians as deceptive merchants. Despite their animosity, they cooperated with each other during the Vulpesummer and Lupuswinter. In the summer, they would set down their weapons for the rich harvests, but during the winter there would be unceasing conflict due to hunger.[1]\nOne Lupuswinter lasted far longer than usual, causing mass starvation. A prophet saw the end of the world and made a wish to Yaoshi for sustenance. This person is known as lady Tushan in foxian legends, while the borisins believe it was a man named Duran. Yaoshi split the mountains and the divine nectar of the Redspring poured forth. Those who drank from the Redspring gained vitality and strength from the meat of beasts they ate.

Many of them were eventually rescued by the Xianzhou Alliance, becoming one of the three main races of the alliance and the dominant culture on the Xianzhou Yaoqing. Thousands of years later, they still fight tirelessly for the liberation of their kin.[5]\nUnder the borisin, the Denizens of Abundance were involved with three large-scale wars against the Xianzhou Alliance. The borisin once invaded Thalassa, but were driven out by the High-Cloud Quintet. After the capture and imprisonment of the Abundance Axis's last Warhead, Hoolay, the coalition has greatly declined in strength, and the borisin political landscape was plunged into a state of extreme instability.[6]\nAfter the foxians joined the Xianzhou Alliance, many of them who wished to rebuild their homeland formed the Verdantia Sect, which merged with the Homeward Sect. To this day, they remain a political force to be reckoned with. From the merging of the two sects, it is observed that their style of faith stands as something akin to a slogan for the Homeward Sect, as well as the Verdantia Sect. All those foxians want is to be back in their homeland, Verdantia.[7]\n"

        "content": "The High Elders are leaders of the Vidyadhara of the Xianzhou Alliance. There are five High Elders, who each lead their respective clans.[1]\nSome time after the exodus of the Vidyadhara from their homeworld, they made an agreement with the Xianzhou Alliance who offered their people a new home, and migrated to five of the six Xianzhou ships.[2] They are responsible for keeping watch over the plaguemarks, also known as Traces of Abundance, that exist on each Xianzhou ship.[3]\nThe High Elders have the power to summon the forces of nature and have significantly greater Cloudhymn abilities than the average Vidyadhara.[4] Bailu was able to call down lightning and command the waters at an early age. The Preceptors shackled her tail with the Dragonhorn Pilory to prevent her from losing control of her powers.[5] Dan Feng was able to wipe out an opposing borisin army with storms and tsunamis as he floated on top of clouds, watching the enemies getting swallowed by the water.[6] Dan Heng was able to part the waters of Scalegorge Waterscape and easily fend off multiple attempts on his and Bailu's lives by assassins. The Luofu High Elder can also seal and unseal the Ambrosial Arbor.[7] Historically, Caelorum Venti was known for slaying the Hundred Hands abomination.[8]\nHigh Elders are able to re-experience the events of their dragon ancestors' lives after receiving the Orb of Abysm and the Transmutation Arcanum. The dreams tend to be fragmentary and difficult to understand but it is the closest they come to Permanence. Yunyou reported to the Vidyadhara Preceptors that Bailu did not have dreams and believed that this was because her dragon heart was damaged and the Transmutation Arcanum had not been successfully completed. However Bailu later reveals that she did indeed have dreams, but refused to tell anyone about them.[5][7] Dan Heng has had several fragmented dreams of Dan Feng's memories.[9][10]\nThe High Elder is considered the existence closest to the Permanence among the Vidyadhara. The power was a rare inheritance that could only be passed down to those who successfully completed numerous rites and challenges, during which their physical features slowly transformed to resemble their predecessors and they are able to turn into dragons. The succession involves a secret ritual known as the Transmutation Arcanum, and a treasure known as the dragon heart. Once the succession is completed, the former High Elder undergoes a hatching rebirth while the new High Elder begins to display draconic features.[7][11][12]\nDespite Bailu being the High Elder of the Vidyadhara on the Luofu, she does not hold the title of Imbibitor Lunae as the Preceptors are waiting until after her coming-of-age ceremony to confer the title upon her.[13] As a result, the title of Imbibitor Lunae is currently not held by anyone.\nBefore they had left their homeworld and moved to the Xianzhou, the Vidyadhara already had a tradition of selecting High Elders. These High Elders were not only leaders of their clans, but also individuals who possessed the power of the dragon ancestor and could transform into draconic forms.[1]\nIn the Year 4800 Star Calendar, the five lineages of the Vidyadhara made an alliance on the Yuque, putting their sacred vow into writing. \"This oath shall remain unbroken, standing stronger than even earth and steel.\"[10] Glaciator Marum signed the covenant with the Alliance on behalf of the Vidyadhara, and the five High Elders were bound to keep watch over the respective plaguemarks of each Xianzhou ship. To accomplish this, Imbibitor Lunae Yubie, High Elder of the Luofu at the time, made the decision to flood Scalegorge Waterscape with the waters of the ancient sea in order to help the Luofu seal the Ambrosial Arbor. The statue at Dragonvista Rain Hall was erected in honor of this.[4] As a reward for their watch over the plaguemarks, the Alliance granted the Vidyadhara the Xianzhou Fanghu to rule as an autonomous ship.[14]\nDan Feng used the Transformation Arcanum as the means for resurrecting Baiheng, who lost her life during a battle with Shuhu. The ritual failed, resulting in his healing powers going to Bailu while his destruction powers remained with his reincarnation, Dan Heng. Dan Heng also retained fragmented memories from his past life. Jing Yuan suggests that the Preceptors denied Dan Heng a true rebirth. The Transmutation Arcanum is said to contain a secret which allows the Vidyadhara to escape the cycle of reincarnation and return to a natural reproduction cycle.[7][12][15]\nA draconic abomination was born in the process of Dan Feng's failed resurrection using the Transmutation Arcanum. The Vidyadhara Preceptors sought the Transmutation Arcanum from Dan Feng because they saw the draconic abomination as a sign of the ritual's success. The old chief alchemist saw \"that little girl\" as the key to the Transmutation Arcanum and the draconic abomination as a step to solving the Vidyadhara's inability to reproduce. According to her, Dan Feng's changes to the Transmutation Arcanum created the draconic abomination, which was also a new life and the hope that will allow the Vidyadhara to one day reproduce. The process involves incorporating the flesh of other species to unlock the potential of Long's blood.[7]\n"

        "content": "The Sky-Faring Commission is in charge of affairs related to Xianzhou's internal airspace and interstellar navigation. All matters related to aviation, navigation, and trade fall under their jurisdiction, as well as starskiff maintenance. On the Luofu, it is headquartered in the Palace of Astrum under the oversight of Helm Master Madame Yukong, who leads the commission. Numerous guilds under the Sky-Faring Commission's administration conduct trade and bring in business for the Luofu. Starskiff Haven, the official entrance of Luofu and its largest port, is also governed by the Sky-Faring Commission.\nThe Xianzhou Alliance communicates with each other via the Yellowbell system, and its resonances are presumably received by each ship's Sky-Faring Commission.[1] On the Luofu, Yellowbell resonances are personally reviewed by Helm-Master Yukong and her secretary Xikui.[2] Surveillance and intelligence reports are also sent and received between ships.[3]\nCurrently, there are seven trade guilds affiliated with the Luofu Sky-Faring Commission: the Whistling Flames, the Celestial, the Securocrat, the Goldstream, the Plainfeather, the Firefly, and the Aquaglider.[4]\nThe Whistling Flames guild is led by Amicassador Tingyun. Its scope of trade is various products for refinement. In addition to industrial processing materials, the guild also handles farming products, breeding, and transformations. It has the fastest and safest bio-transport vessels in the galaxy.[4]\nThe Celestial guild is led by Amicassador Yanming. It handles trades of art and literary products.[4] This guild is not one all-encompassing body, but rather a consortium of many smaller guilds.[5]\nThe Securocrat guild is led by Amicassador Changqing. Its scope of trade is various weapons and military products. Any export of military technology must first be approved by the Sky-Faring Commission.[4]\nThe Goldstream guild is led by Amicassador Changwen. This guild handles the import and export of medical and health-related products. Based on the Sky-Faring Commission Trade Management Regulations, any pharmaceutical products not included in the trading allowlist must undergo inspection. Offenders are strictly prohibited from trading with the Luofu.[4]\nThe Plainfeather guild is led by Amicassador Zhiyao. Its scope of trade is various starskiff-related products. In addition to starskiff exports, this guild also provides after-sales modding services for starskiffs so that they match various different lifestyle and cultural themes.[4]\nThe Firefly guild is led by Amicassador Yunling. Its scope of trade is various goods within the Xianzhou Alliance network. This guild gathers specialties from all over the galaxy onto the Luofu: the Zhuming's porcelain, the Fanghu's marine products, the Yuque's jade abaci, and various other specialties from other Xianzhou vessels.[4]\nThe Aquaglider guild is led by Amicassador Zhongchu. Its scope of trade is various secondary-industry products, such as agricultural by-products, raw chemical and textile materials, and more. This guild undertakes trades for almost all industries, and owns a huge fleet of spaceships. They are the largest of the seven guilds aboard the Xianzhou Luofu.[4]\nYueyan was the Helm Master of the Xianzhou Yaoqing's Sky-Faring Commission during the Year 5700 Star Calendar.[6] He witnessed Muldrasil's total destruction by the Antimatter Legion while the Alliance stood by and observed, as it aligned with their creed of eradicating abominations. Yueyan was shaken by the overwhelming death and destruction and proclaimed that he had to re-think the long-life species' purpose in life. He later left his position, and after witnessing Shuhu granting life to the long-dead planet Rahu, became the first master primus of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus.[7]\nDuring Qingying's tenure as Helm Master of the Yaoqing, the Sky-Faring Commission sent a delegation containing Baiheng and a dozen others to request for arms and reinforcements from the Xianzhou Zhuming, for the Yaoqing's Heroncrest Fleet, who were occupied with fighting the borisin. They were recieved by General Huaiyan's apprentice, Yingxing, at Radiant Zenith and escorted through by the Flamedisk Forge Palace. There, the delegation met with Huaiyan, who was willing to allocate three hundred fighter jets, twenty thousand thunder crossbows, and twenty thousand devastator glaives in response to Qingying's request for reinforcements, but only a dozen or so personnel.[8]\nFollowing the Third Abundance War in Year 8072 Star Calendar, the Fanghu adopted self-preservation policies to recuperate from the damage inflicted upon them, and even briefly stopped issuing new travel passes. As a result, they cut off most of their regular communications and trade with the other Xianzhou ships. This decision was made by the Fanghu's High Elder, Glaciator Marum. After the new travel policy was put into place, the ship opened up to visitors once more.[9]\nIn Year 8098 Star Calendar, the Fanghu transmitted through the Yellowbell system that they were currently moored at the Lanadi star system in the Tlaltecuhtli. The Yaoqing reported several victories against abominations in different locations. The Yuque sent their surveillance reports to the other Helm Masters, the Xuling reported \"Business as usual here,\" and the Zhuming reported that they were currently moored in the Le Roy Ladurie cluster's Stella Yamazaki star system, inside the territory of the Klimt Republic.[2]\n"

        "session_name": "starskiff",
        "url": "https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com//wiki/Starskiff",
        "content": "Starskiff traffic, inspection, maintenance, aviation, navigation, and trade within the Xianzhou is managed by the Sky-Faring Commission. The Department of Aviation in the Sky-Faring Commission is specifically responsible for relevant aviation tasks such as receiving, verifying and managing the reports of vessels entering and exiting its jurisdiction, the registration of new starskiffs, and the dynamic monitor system. Starskiffs on the Luofu are grown in Stargazer Navalia. They are used by various merchant guilds and by the Cloud Knights.\nStarskiffs are grown, not manufactured, which may come as a surprise to most outworlders. Starskiffs are grown from starskiff seeds. Developed from the Ambrosial Arbor, a starskiff seed acts a blueprint as all of the growth data for a starskiff is stored inside its seed. In other words, these seeds come with their own \"design manuscripts,\" and each seed grows step-by-step based on the design plan. A culture medium injector and cultivation cabin are used to grow the starskiff seed inside the incubator. The incubator is filled with the culture medium that supports the starskiff seed during the germination phase, and it can ensure the biological material grows in a nutritious and controllable environment. In the absence of any external stimulus and with sufficient nutrition, a starskiff seed will grow into a keel in one go. If regular plants were to be placed in the culture medium, they would grow exponentially.\nGenerally, the ratio of catalyzers in the culture medium is fixed. However, it can be adjusted based on the design of the ship. Depending on the composition ratio, the strength and growth speed of the hull will vary. There are craftsmen from the Artisanship Commission who specialize in researching the ratio needed for the culture medium during the germination phase, so as to make the ship lighter, more durable, and safer. There are many cylindrical \"culture medium injectors\" at various phases along the starskiff assembly line to make fine-tuned adjustments to it as it grows. There are four main stages in the growth of a starskiff: the germination phase, the embryonic phase, the nutritive phase, and the forming phase. During the germination phase, materials such as Fallow Earth and Ligneous Freeroamers inside the starskiff seed will form the earliest signs of seed germ and embryo. If anything goes wrong during the growth process, the failed starskiff seed needs to be cleared out and the biological matter in the metal frame needs to be destroyed.\nThe embryonic phase is the most important stage in shaping the starskiff. If the temperature and culture medium isn't regulated properly, or if the design data has any errors, then the starskiff seed will fail to grow as designed. A failed seed can still be cleared out at this stage, though some fast-growing anomalies can burst through the incubator, causing the culture medium to leak out. When that happens, the incubator basically just gets trashed. This can happen due to errors such as a miscalculated self-growth algorithm of Fallow Earth. The starskiff seeds develop a detailed and complex root system during subsequent phases, which also acts as the internal jade abacus network aboard each starskiff. The toughest biological materials on the exterior will gradually close up, so that the starskiff can continue its core internal operations even when it encounters severe impacts. The starskiff is technically flyable at this stage if a jade wheel is installed.\nIn the nutritive phase, the starskiff has taken shape and is nearly done incubating, developing it's hull, keel and canopy. The circular cutaway on the tail is where the jade wheel gets installed — that's the starskiff engine. It's an integrated jade abacus that controls gravity and motion. The Meridian Pin at Stargazer Navalia also operates using similar tech principles. During the forming phase, fully-grown starskiffs are extracted from their incubators and temporarily moored at The Mooring platform in Stargazer Navalia following assembly.[2]\nThe jade wheel functions as the starskiff engine. As aforementioned, it's an integrated jade abacus that controls gravity and motion. There are a lot of illegal modders who will exploit this, installing military-grade jade wheels onto civilian starskiffs, which is illegal and highly dangerous. There are mooring platforms all around the Xianzhou for starskiffs to dock. Starskiffs can also function when slightly submerged in water.[2][3]\nLarge fighter starskiffs are equipped with turrets that are operated by a gunner.[4] They fire \"alchemical arrows.\"[5]\nFighter jet starskiffs are typically grouped into Cloud Knight brigades known as Orbital Fleets.[6]\nThe civilian models are single-pilot vessels that resembles a small sampan boat and appears to have the capacity to hold at least four people. Large cargo seems to be generally stored outside the cockpit on the deck. There are several starskiff brands and models such as the Blitzing Silver Thread, the Lion on the Deer Plains, and the Azure Phoenix of the Skies.\nBlitz Corp's Mountain Kite starskiff features the lightweight design of the Kite series and uses the latest mortise and tenon technology, which endows the vehicle with elegant contours. Simply sitting in the driver's seat allows one to feel the deep and magnetic growl of the Sunhunt engine, the same model as the ones in the Cloud Knight's fighter jets. The completely enclosed driver's seat and inner cockpit recreates the driving experience of competition vessels. \nFor pilots with peculiar tastes, the Mountain Kite allows one to pre-order starskiff engine sets with different power settings. The Mountain Kite is designed with a customizable control panel that allows every pilot to adjust the starskiff's functions according to their habits. Compared to the expansive control panels of the starskiffs of the previous generation, the clean and intelligent panels of the Mountain Kite is said to be more suitable for new pilots.\nThe latest stall control system designed by the Artisanship Commission is used for the first time in the Mountain Kite, and the drift correction device has also been completely upgraded. This latest patented equipment can use intelligent braking to control the yaw angle of the starskiff, and ensures the safety of the vessel even when performing aerobatic flights.[7] Smaller starskiffs cannot travel beyond the Jade Gate, and there are larger models that can hold more passengers.[8]\nAccording to Hongjin, the Luofu starskiff's shape is dull and plain, and less aesthetic than the ones on the Fanghu.[9]\nFreight starskiffs are unmanned models of starskiffs used to transport cargo containers between various locations on the Xianzhou. They are larger and rectangular-shaped. There are three known models; light, medium and heavy. Additional \"carriages\" can be attached behind these starskiffs in order to ferry more cargo.\nFighter starskiffs are generally used by the Cloud Knights air force. Large fighter starskiffs need to be operated in pairs. One pilot takes the helm, the other controls the turrets. Cloud Knight fighter jets use the Sunhunt engine model.[4]\nThe star jet is a type of starskiff mentioned in a Management Strategy for Reporting Starskiff Traffic.\nA competition fly ship is a type of starskiff mentioned in a Management Strategy for Reporting Starskiff Traffic. It is presumably used for sport in some form of competitive flying.\nStarskiffs on the Yaoqing are born with biotechnology instead of being grown from seeds. Newly born starskiffs are described as \"furry little creatures\". They can even be named, and may join the battlefield after growing in a few short months, becoming loyal partners of the Verdant Knights, capable of eradicating abominations. New starskiffs are born almost every day in Verdant Harbor. Their description resembles the beast ships used by the borisin.[10]\nThe Verdant Knights were seen aboard an unknown model of boarding craft that shares a similar hull structure to battleships.[11]\nThe Xianzhou Alliance also employs large military vessels like battleships that boast massive cannons. One such vessel was the Skysplitter, though it's combat armor has been removed.[12] The battleship is large enough to accommodate several starskiffs and has a mooring zone specifically for starskiffs to dock. It is also where the battleship's cargo are processed. It is capable capable of transporting countless Cloud Knights to the battlefield and provided low-altitude support for ground forces. Internal cabins and the lower deck are located below the massive open-air deck at the center.\nThe Control Room's control screens monitor every aspect of the battleship such as fuel levels, starskiff data, radar scans, and logistics operations. The Engine Room is the beating heart of the battleship, and it is rumored that the power generated by the ship's twin engines is strong enough to propel a small asteroid.[13] The command center located at the bow of the ship serves the role of the military command center, with control panels and strategic astral charts used by the captain of the ship for strategic planning.[14]\nBattleships like the Skysplitter may be smaller in tonnage, but the genius designers at the Artisanship Commission managed to equip it with features that are available on larger ships — a large-caliber main gun and numerous rapid-fire auxiliary guns. There are at least four three-barreled large-caliber guns and eighteen four-barreled rapid-fire auxiliary guns.[15]\nThe Navis Astriger is a type of Cloud Knight troop carrier starskiff. It was used in the Heliobi Wars during the weaponizing of the Yaoqing's auxillary engine.[16] One was forced to land on an ocean planet infested by abominations during Jing Yuan's first expedition before heading back to the Luofu.[17] Baiheng once flew one from the Xianzhou Yaoqing to the Xianzhou Zhuming carrrying a delegation of at least a dozen people.[18] Fu Xuan proposed a plan to use a Navis Astriger to ferry the Yuque's Cloudpeer Telescope, which was described as a towering spire reaching into the sky, to the Fanghu during the Third Abundance War to send an SOS signal to the Reignbow Arbiter, the plan was carried out by Master Diviner Jing Tian of the Yuque.[19]\nNavium Astriger, more commonly known as Xianzhou ships, are the large planet-sized capital ships that form the Xianzhou Alliance. There were only nine known ships that were constructed by the Primeval Imperium civilization that were sent out to seek immortality. Of the nine, only six of the ships still remain to form the Hexafleet.[20] According to March 7th, the Luofu appeared to be larger than Jarilo-VI.[21]\nThe interior space of Xianzhou ships is even larger on the inside due to space-folding technology. The visible space in Starskiff Haven is enough to fill up the entire Luofu. Strange planets can be seen high in the sky, it is unknown if some of them are projections of the delve's artificial sky dome, but the Xianzhou extracts heat from the core of a planet the ship is carrying.[22][23] The delves all vary in size and shape, but they are all said to be on a scale that was too large for any normal ship to contain from the perspective of the Intelligentsia Guild.[1] The wind, clouds, rain, and fog are all artificial and managed onboard the Xianzhou.[24]\n"

The Disciples use this text as part of their initiation rite for prospective members, who must record the text 500 times.[5] The Thousand-Handed Merciful Medicus' Salvation is a forgery according to the official announcement from the Ten-Lords Commission.[6]\nOn Year 5749 Star Calendar, Shuhu led the Denizens of Abundance in an invasion of the Xianzhou Yuque, but was defeated by the Xianzhou Alliance with the help of the Intelligentsia Guild.[7]\nIn Year 6300 Star Calendar, Rahu — the planet Shuhu had revived — devoured and destroyed the Xianzhou Cangcheng.[8]\nAbout 700 years ago, the High-Cloud Quintet formed to save the Yuque from a Denizens of Abundance invasion.[9] At some point in this era, Shuhu was presumably involved in an event known as The Shuhu Upheaval witnessed by Jing Yuan.[10] According to Jingliu[11] and presumably Phantylia[12], Shuhu rallied a great army to attack the Luofu and set up the Sanguinary Abyss to block the Xianzhou soldiers. Dan Feng fell into Dragon's Delirium when fighting Shuhu. Then, Baiheng charged ahead and shattered the enemy's defenses, allowing the Xianzhou soldiers to break through Shuhu's Sanguinary Abyss and awaken Dan Feng from his Dragon's Delirium.[11] Shuhu was eventually defeated by Baiheng's self-destruct attack, but it is unclear if Shuhu was actually killed.[13] Jingliu also says that Yingxing used the flesh of an Abundance Emanator to aid Dan Feng in resurrecting Baiheng, leading to Yingxing's transformation into an abomination now known as Blade.[11]\nAfter attacking the Xianzhou Alliance, Shuhu disappeared and there are no records of his remains according to Jingliu.[11] According to the Ten-Lords Commission Criminal Directory, Shuhu's remains are said to be kept in a box held in the deepest depths of the prison. However, the box is not to be opened unless directly ordered by the marshal and the Ten Lords together.[14]\n"

Soon afterward, a flash of light cleaved apart the sky, leaving behind abnormal rainbow-colored traces.

Her father was both proud of her talents and afraid of her future as a musketeer, while her mother cared for her and blamed him for teaching her. Oakley however, was only interested in learning so she could earn her father's felt hat. He taught her not only how to shoot, but how to cover her preparatory movements under her cloak before the duel even started.[1]\nOne day, while Oakley was young, a bounty hunter from afar came to her home and challenged her father to a duel to the death at high noon. The bounty hunter's skill left Oakley in a stupor, and left a strong impression on her after her father was killed that quickly turned into an lifelong obsession to get revenge. Using the skills she developed as a child, Oakley set out to become a bounty hunter in an attempt to find him. Her mother, while previously against her daughter learning to shoot, gave her a pair of gloves as a parting gift as she had already accepted Oakley's choice. Tucking wheat into her father's hat, she then began to take jobs in remote and far off locations in hopes of running into the solitary hunter.[2]\nOakley quickly became known as the Wild Wheat, and gained a reputation among her fellow bounty hunters as someone who was thoughtless, expressionless, and leaving her opponents with no hope: a reputation that upset her as she realized she was becoming more and more like her nemesis.[3] Even so, she hoped that this reputation will eventually cause him to seek her out like he did with her father.[4]\nOnce, while riding the Astral Express near the border planet of Frati, the former Navigator and passengers all vanished mysteriously due to an anomaly. At the request of the conductor, Oakley temporarily assumed the position of Navigator. While Navigator, Oakley defended the Express from several savage star beasts, brought the Express back to safety, and assisted in finding missing passengers and gathering new passengers. After gathering a sufficient number of new passengers, Oakley quietly left the Express. She remains the Astral Express Navigator with the shortest tenure, at six months and two days.[5]\nShe has notable skill with a harmonica, enough for others to tell legends that the wind has once stood and listened to her play.\n\n"

To escape the rising deepwater pressure, the aqua sprites migrated upward and now dwell in submerged cities that were formerly home to land-dwellers. The land-dwellers, also known as Luvians, reside in gigantic stateships that search for artifacts from the Old Era and any traces of land. The battles of the past have been long-forgotten, and Luvians and aqua sprites coexist peacefully, each race too preoccupied with their own survival to give the other any significant notice.[2][3]\n"

Unofficial history from the Primal Waking Library states that Hanunue was an ordinary Asdana wolf who broke into the frontier prison and bit an IPC guard, triggering mutiny among the inmates.[4] Based on Graysen's information, the second story is likely the closest to the truth.\nLike his cartoon counterpart, he only spoke in grunts.[5]\nHanunue was a wanted interstellar criminal hailing from the Harbeck clan on Nashoba. In 2147 Amber Era, he singlehandedly masterminded the tumult in the Montour System. He was eventually apprehended and sentenced by the IPC, and served his time in Asdana's frontier prison.[2]\nWithin just a few years of being sent to Asdana, he began to riot against the prison guards and ignited the rebellion that would be come to known as the War of Independence.[2] At some point he awarded the Fanghunter Medal to Tiernan.[6]\nDuring a defensive battle against the IPC, Hanunue was injured by multiple \"crocodile\" ships and crashed into the enemy's main ship. Infiltrating the vessel, he fought head-to-head with a person in high-grade IPC battlesuit and took over the mech, using its life support devices to heal his injuries. He then located the ship's command center and ammunition warehouse. The Watchmaker noted that even with enough ammunition, Hanunue could not destroy all the \"crocodile\" ships on his own, but the werewolf had a different idea — detonating the warehouse to cause a massive explosion.[5]\nDespite the Watchmaker's pleas, Hanunue sacrificed himself to detonate the ammunition warehouse, destroying all the invading \"crocodiles\" and causing massive damage to the main ship. He sustained grave injuries and remained unconscious after he was recovered from enemy lines. To reassure the other rebels, the Watchmaker told them Hanunue was only temporarily out of action and would continue making significant decisions in Penacony. The Watchmaker later had a dream in which he and Hanunue had a conversation, the latter telling him \"as long as this is a dream, you'll have to wake up from it sooner or later.\" Hanunue presumably passed away after that dream.[5]\n"

The alderson disks have several landmasses and bodies of water, which were said to be once barren deserts.[1]\nCity buildings can be seen jutting out on both from the \"top\" and \"underside\" of the alderson disks.

However, the cost of fulfilling those desires often brings great disaster to the world. There is no known way to destroy a Stellaron; currently, the most that can be done is contain its energy.[4]\nStellarons have been known to be capable of communication with a particular person of interest, an example being Cocolia, likely in order to carry out the desires of the world.[5][6] The Trailblazer, who holds such a Stellaron within their body, is able to hear its voice as well.\nThe Stellaron Hunters, who serve an enigmatic individual known as Elio, scour the world for Stellarons and have obtained several. Their intentions are currently unclear — Kafka appears to know the Trailblazer's background and implanted a Stellaron in their body for an unknown reason.[7]\nThe Antimatter Legion and Nanook the Destruction may have a connection to Stellarons, due to the frequent appearance of new Stellarons shortly after these destroyers of universes appear on worlds. It is currently unknown if these occurrences are related or just coincidence.[1][3][5][8]\nAt some point in the past, Herta obtained a Stellaron and hid it within the Herta Space Station. Kafka and Silver Wolf, two Stellaron Hunters, are dispatched by Elio to uncover it and implant it within the Trailblazer for the foreseeable future. They succeed in their task by luring the Antimatter Legion into attacking the space station as a distraction, and depart before the Astral Express' crew can find them, leaving the Trailblazer behind.[9]\nWhile battling against the Doomsday Beast, the Trailblazer blocks an attack directed at March 7th, which causes the Stellaron inside them to lose control. However, Welt seals the Stellaron before they are entirely consumed by its energy.[10]\nLong ago, the Antimatter Legion invaded Jarilo-VI and caused great devastation. The first Supreme Guardian, Alisa Rand, asked the Stellaron for help. The Stellaron fulfilled her wishes by causing a phenomenon that came to be known as the Eternal Freeze: a sudden massive drop in the world's temperature that caused the entire world to freeze over, with the exception of Belobog, which remains humanity's last bastion due to the efforts of The Architects and the Aeon they worship, Qlipoth the Preservation.[11]\nWhen the Astral Express arrived on Jarilo-VI, they discovered that the Stellaron was responsible for the Eternal Freeze and had corrupted the current Supreme Guardian, Cocolia Rand. After defeating Cocolia, Welt sealed the Stellaron, though its ecological effects would still remain due to the Stellaron's long duration on the planet.[12]\nLord Ravager Phantylia masterminded a plot to smuggle a Stellaron aboard the Xianzhou Luofu with the help of Luocha and the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus.[13] Phantylia's goal was to bring about the self-destruction of the Xianzhou,[14] while Luocha's involvement is implied to be related to his opposition against Yaoshi. The Stellaron Hunters detected this Stellaron and manipulated the Astral Express crew into helping the Luofu with the Stellaron crisis, with the intention of making the Xianzhou indebted to the crew in preparation for a great conflict with Nanook in the future.[15][16]\nPhantylia used the revived Ambrosial Arbor to create a physical body for herself, and fought the Astral Express crew and General Jing Yuan with her new body at the Ambrosial Arbor's roots. After Phantylia was defeated, the Stellaron was sealed.[17]\nA Stellaron entered Penacony when it was still a prison planet under the ownership of the Interastral Peace Corporation, during the War of Independence.[18] Its ensuing eruption and the chaos of the war led to the IPC losing control of Penacony.[15] After the war ended, \"people in the shadows with ulterior motives\" had the idea of using the Stellaron's power to help build Penacony's Dreamscape. By the time a representative from The Family arrived at The Watchmaker's call, the Stellaron had already been activated and was seeping into the Primordial Dreamscape.[18] The Family, possessing extensive knowledge of Stellarons, helped the Watchmaker subdue the Stellaron. However, traitors within the Family ensured that the Stellaron was not fully sealed, so its influence would linger within the Dreamscape and tempt people with indulgence and pleasure, using their minds as nourishment for the sweet dream.[18]\nBy the time the Watchmaker realized this, the Family already had a firm grip on Penacony and swiftly quelled any opposition that arose. At the Watchmaker's behest, Gallagher sent Charmony Festival invitations to various factions in the hopes of finding people capable of resolving the Stellaron disaster.[19][18] It is later revealed that the Stellaron is housed within Penacony Grand Theater. The traitors planned to use the Stellaron's power and the Harmony's song, broadcast through the Charmony Festival, to brainwash everyone on Penacony into following the Path of Order.[20] Though they nearly succeed, their plans are foiled and the Stellaron is sealed by the Astral Express crew.[21]\nThe Jepella Brotherhood accused Kafka of 46 crimes, likely all linked to obtaining a Stellaron.[22] Some of these are:\nA Stellaron was also present in Kafka's home planet, and while the extent of damage is unknown, she remarks on how she was unable to see how far it fell at the time.[23]\nThe Xianzhou Yuque, monitoring various enemy movements across the galaxy, obtained a report from the IPC that the Peacock Angel legion of the wingweavers arrived at the Consternation Starzone to look for a Stellaron there, hoping to use it to revive their homeworld of Muldrasil.[24] Whether this Stellaron is actually present and whether the wingweavers were able to obtain it is unknown.\nLushaka, the oceanic home planet of the Watchmaker, had its landscape transformed long ago by a Stellaron. The Stellaron responded to the wishes of an aqua sprite who had lost her home in the war against land-dwellers. Meteors began falling from the sky, raising the sea level and engulfing all landmasses. The planet's water levels are still rising to this day.[25]\n"

This ushered a heroic era of the Trailblaze, earning him the titles of \"Morning Star\" and \"Enlightenment Beacon\" for his exceptional leadership. However, Falcon died prematurely in the early years of his voyage.[2]\nAccording to Clockie: Dreamjoy Memoir — Chronometer Chronicles, the Express once arrived at a \"gloomy town\" shrouded in darkness. Somehow the sun was getting dimmer and dimmer, making the townsfolk grow despondent. The Crew found the suspect behind the dark shade cast over the town — the \"Bombheads\" in the cartoon. To reignite the sun over the gloomy town, Falcon flew off into the sky, leading the remaining Bombheads up into the dark skies. The Bombheads were ignited by the sun's embers, and their explosions ignited the extinguished sun. Light and heat returned to the land, but Falcon would not be returning to the Express ever again and presumably died.[1]\nThe Trailblaze Timer is presumably the relic of Falcon, which was later fixed by Mikhail Char Legwork.[3][4]\nAfter his death, Granholm succeeded the navigator role.

Other galleries also suffered damage of unknown extent. The Nightingale Family, in collaboration with the Garden of Recollection staff in Penacony repaired and reopened the museum in 10 system hours.[10]\n1 Character matches the category selection:\n"

Blue Hour is said to be very romantic, featuring a dock, a large boat called the \"Eventide\" anchored along the Sea of Dreams where extravagant balls and marriage services are organized, and an airship called the Radiant Feldspar that sails through all dreamscapes.[8][9][10] Oasis has natural scenes such as Sunshine Park and a beach while Stars has an amusement park, clubs, casinos, and various competitions, including Spheroid, Roboball, and Unicycler.[2][11][12][13][14][5] The Moment of Midnight is the starting point of all dreams. People tend to overlook this moment, believing there's nothing beyond the inky darkness it presents. Chuckles and laughter can be heard from entering the dream.[1]\n"

        "content": "The Galaxy Rangers is a voluntarily formed group that travels around the cosmos to uphold justice for the locals out of the belief that benevolence and justice must be upheld by personal action.\nWhile members of the Galaxy Rangers hail from different worlds, and have all kinds of personalities and traits, each of them are highly skilled, despises evil, and follows Lan and the Path of The Hunt.\nThey carry a balance scale with them at all times and believe justice in the universe needs to be achieved through individual deeds. They are always accompanied by the song and the sound of horns. They pursue justice for those they encounter along the way and shower them with wines and songs.[1]\nAccording to Aventurine, the Rangers \"come and go like shadows,\" and there's little communication between them.[2] Boothill doesn't think the Galaxy Rangers can even be considered an \"organization\" to begin with as they all follow their own path along The Hunt, with their own resolute sense of righteousness, and don't share so-called universal values.\nThe Galaxy Rangers don't need a form of shared faith. What brings them together is a shared bottom line: Never bully the weak, never kill the innocent. These oaths aren't beliefs, but rather the fundamental bottom line that one must never cross as a person. As Galaxy Rangers, they abide by a common principle and strictly adhere to the bottom line.[3]\nThe Galaxy Rangers have relics in the form of a bullet that appear meaningless to anyone other than a Galaxy Ranger, that can only fulfill its purpose when returned to its rightful owner. This is because it's a burial artifact, worthy only of a hero who has served the Galaxy Rangers with honor. The relic is shot out like a flare and when it is used, it means the fall of a hero, and in the direction it's light falls, Galaxy Rangers will come from all corners of the Cosmos, driven by a shared purpose, without questioning the cause or counting the cost.[4]\nThe Galaxy Rangers first rose to fame with the successful assassination of Lord Ravager Zulo,[5] called \"Operation Zulo.\"[6] Rather than confront him directly, the Rangers manipulated surviving members of The Swarm, making use of their lack of intelligence to their advantage and herding them toward his fleet.[5][7] Before the mission, they saved the life of Breukelen Tiernan, a Nameless who battled for Penacony's independence from the Interastral Peace Corporation. He along with Loretta[6] are so far the only two named Galaxy Rangers to battle Lord Ravager Zulo, and Tiernan disappeared soon after.[4]\nRiding the success of \"Operation Zulo\", the Galaxy Rangers would next defeat the Thirteenth Legion of Gaius the Usurper, the successor of Genius Society Member #27, Emperor Rubert's will. However, their means of accomplishing this are unknown.[5]\nMany years later, the Galaxy Rangers would thwart the 64th member of the Genius Society, Dr. Primitive, and protect the Thousand-Tree Greenwood on Vonwacq. For this, some claim that many Galaxy Rangers would suffer from Degeneration Flow and lose their combat capabilities resulting in the Galaxy Rangers having to cut back on their efforts.[5] Dr. Primitive however took an unknown form of revenge on the Galaxy Rangers, further pushing the Galaxy Rangers into obscurity.[8][9]\nPresently, the Galaxy Rangers and Dr. Primitive are closely intertwined, and even after his rumored death, there are still Rangers who hunt for him.[10] Once, an individual believed to be a Galaxy Ranger sold Dr. Primitive's robes on Device IX's dark web but refused to answer any questions.[11]\nAt some point in the past, the Galaxy Rangers were alerted to a facility run by Laboratory 17 of the AtaviSearch Forest, after one of its researcher became disillusioned after seeing how the others intended to get rid of a promising subject, AK-A-3. After he killed his colleague (who had tried to get rid of her numerous times), the Galaxy Rangers discovered AK-A-3 and her unnatural powers, given to her through experimentation. AK-A-3 gave herself the name Rappa and joined the Galaxy Rangers in order to hunt down the Evil Ninja Osaru.[12]\nWhile the Galaxy Rangers have fallen into a state of scarcity,[2] they are still an active group in the universe and have appeared numerous times in recent events.\nColleen recounts a story about a pirate she used to work with called Wyland, who replaced most of his body with prosthetics. After a masked visitor informed him that void song whale's brain extract could relieve Wyland of his headaches due to old age, Wyland begun to massacre void song whales. He hooked his nervous system up to his ship for maximum efficiency, and at this point the IPC reached out to the Galaxy Rangers to put a stop to him. However, when all their forces arrived Wyland was already dead.[13]\nAnother time, an anonymous Ranger claimed that The Cremators were behind the Holstein Aphasia in 2157 AE, in which the residents of Holstein had all their memories relating to \"language\" stolen. Recently, the Cremators were confirmed to be behind it, and the Galaxy Rangers have announced that the rangers are working on retrieving the stolen memories.[14]\nAt some point, a Galaxy Ranger chased a group of interstellar thieves into Talia. These thieves would later go on to create Nailscrap Town.[15] At some point in time, the Xianzhou Yuque started looking for the leader of of the Galaxy Rangers, La Mancha, hoping to rebuild a connection with the hero.[5]\nThe Self-Annihilator Acheron arrived on Penacony posing as a Galaxy Ranger, which caused Boothill, a real Galaxy Ranger, to seek her out and try to kill her.[16] Upon meeting Acheron himself, she explains to him that given the group's elusive nature and limited contact with each other, she had to devise a plan to \"reach out\" to him. She had done so in order to fulfill a long-standing promise to return Tiernan's relics to their rightful owner.[17] Boothill would use Tiernan's relics to summon Galaxy Rangers from all over the cosmos to the Asdana system to weaken Sunday's dream, which alerted the cosmos at large that the Galaxy Rangers had resurfaced from obscurity. Boothill would later confront Aventurine in order to learn the whereabouts of Oswaldo Schneider to continue his original mission of getting vengeance on the man who destroyed his planet and people.[18][4]\nRappa would later have Boothill accompany her to Penacony after tracking Dr. Primitive to the planet, discovering a plot to turn the planet's populace into monkeys. With the assistance of the Memokeeper Mr. Reca, Robin and the Astral Express, they were able to foil his plan, though Dr. Primitive escaped. After the incident was over, Dr. Reca approached Rappa and gave her remuneration for helping his \"film\" by giving her information on where Dr. Primitive had gone.[19]\n2 Characters match the category selection:\n"

        "content": "Gopher Wood is a mission-exclusive NPC on Penacony, and serves as one of the antagonists in Trailblaze Mission In Our Time.\nGopher Wood was the former Head of the Oak Family, and later became the Dreammaster of The Family's Penacony chapter. Despite his position as a Family leader, he is secretly a Pathstrider of the Order.[1] He has two adoptive children: Sunday and Robin. He is the basis for the cartoon character Old Man Wood.[2]\nWith two of the Nameless gone (Razalina and Tiernan), the Watchmaker had to go to the front lines in Penacony. It was at that moment his rivals saw an opportunity. By the time Gopher Wood the representative from the Montour system's Family arrived at the Watchmaker's call, the Stellaron had already been activated and was seeping into the primordial Synesthesia Dreamscape. The Family knew far more about the Stellaron than the average person. They helped the Watchmaker swiftly quell the civil unrest and played a part in building Penacony, under the disguise of the Harmony. Those three Amber Eras were known as the Age of Dreaming. The Watchmaker, who had been left in the dark, sent out invitations across the universe, spreading the hype around the land of the dreams.[3]\nHowever, the Stellaron was never truly sealed by The Family. It existed in a different form within the Dreamscape: the Penacony Grand Theater itself. The opulent dream is built upon the decay of spirits, with a toxic elixir called \"pleasure\" flowing through the Dreamscape. It tempts people to indulge in the Dreamscape, and gradually their minds succumb, becoming nourishment for the sweet dream. Weaknesses that plague humanity were magnified and nourished by The Family. Penacony became a new kind of prison, even more impenetrable than the previous one. Sadly, the Watchmaker realized this far too late. By then, The Family had a firm grip on Penacony, swiftly quelling any opposition that arose.[3]\nWhen Gopher Wood first arrived in Penacony, he was described as a kind person and a gentleman by the Watchmaker.[4] During the period when the Watchmaker went to the front lines, the townsfolk had a dispute with Gopher Wood, but he forgave the townsfolk for their transgressions and silently resumed his work. The Watchmaker noticed that people were beginning to dislike Gopher Wood, so he held a lecture/grand banquet for Gopher Wood, and the Alfalfa Family became friends with Gopher Wood.[5]\nAccording to Clockie: Dreamjoy Memoir — Dreammyth Escapade, \"Banana Assassin\" failed to assassinate the Watchmaker and the Alfalfa Family Head. The Bloodhound Family suspected that Gopher Wood was the mastermind, but Banana Assassin eventually admitted that it was \"Grandpa Pine\" all along. With the help of the Watchmaker, the nefarious townsfolk were all arrested and brought to justice. Gopher Wood forgave the townsfolk who framed him and was willing to accept them as his helpers. As Gopher Wood's reputation ascended, the Watchmaker's faith in this friend similarly grew stronger.[5] It is unknown who were the basis for Grandpa Pine and Banana Assassin in the cartoon.\nAfter the fall of the traitor, the Watchmaker proposed the idea of inviting more Dreamchasers from the Cosmos to aid in the development effort, and Gopher Wood agreed. The population in Penacony began to grow. Gopher Wood diligently listened to various reports remotely and approved each new regulation that emerged. The Watchmaker recognized his duty and stepped forward to assist Gopher Wood in governing Penacony. Soon, the Watchmaker realized that he was not suitable for this job. His sense of responsibility causes a lot of trouble for Gopher Wood.[5]\nAs Penacony developed, the land was divided into individual private territories. The Dreamchaser rebels within the territory no longer heeded the jurisdiction of Gopher Wood. The rebels often fought for the ownership of the territory, to the extent of going against Gopher Wood. Complaints swarmed toward the heart of the town like snowflakes, and Gopher Wood finally decided to act and discipline these rebels. He then sent out the guards to arrest the disobedient Dreamchasers and educated them.[5]\nThe Watchmaker suggested to Gopher Wood that they should devise a plan to reclaim their lands and unify Penacony. The Watchmaker began to negotiate with the rebels and find a way to reconcile. However, the contradictions between the two factions could not be resolved overnight. To seize the most fertile land in the desert, the rebels got into a violent conflict with Gopher Wood's guards. Asna, Head of the Iris Family, embarked on her concert tour through the wasteland, singing songs of peace to quell both factions' anger. Unfortunately, along the way, she encountered the lingering remnants of monsters and was killed. Neither the rebels nor Gopher Wood rescued her, and they blamed each other for it.[5]\nThe rebel boss began to recruit soldiers, gearing up for an imminent large-scape battle. Mercenaries from the Cosmos could be seen marching toward the desert. Gopher Wood preemptively investigated the rebels' movements and got rid of their mercenaries. To counter Gopher Wood, the rebel boss planted explosives in his home. Unfortunately, Gopher Wood failed to detect anything amiss and unknowingly entered the house. His house collapsed in explosion. Glaux and the Nightingale Family managed to rescued him, but his wings were severed in the explosion.[6] Seeing how badly wounded Gopher Wood was, the Watchmaker felt remorseful. Sensing his inability to make significant decisions in town, the Watchmaker no longer wanted to hold back Gopher Wood and quietly vanished.[5]\nGopher Wood could no longer tolerate the rebels. To ensure the welfare of the remaining townsfolk, he ventured into the desert alone and confronted the rebels, extending countless \"branches\" as he showed no mercy in using his power. In the end, the rebels were apprehended and chased out of Penacony by Gopher Wood. And for those who surrendered, he accepted them as new generations of townsfolk. Since then, the Dreamchasers and the townsfolk have united as one. While Penacony reunited with the new lands, the Watchmaker had reappeared before Gopher Wood.[5]\nIn 2151 AE, the long-prepared Dreamweaving Project had officially launched. The Twelve Dreamscapes were slated to be completed within this Amber Era. As construction of the Twelve Dreamscapes was almost near its end, the Oak Family Head Gopher Wood declared the \"unity of the five major lineages.\" Glaux and the Nightingale Family initially refused to join The Family. However, their members were brutally treated by the Hounds from the Bloodhound Family. Under pressure, Glaux retired and Fischer succeeded the Head. The Nightingale Family eventually joined the Family, and the Paperfold Acadamy has been kept to protect the Dreamweavers better.[7]\nAs construction of the Twelve Dreamscapes was completed, Gopher Wood was pleased with the result. Seeing Penacony developing into a wealthy and bustling place, the IPC surprisingly extended an olive branch to Penacony, and Gopher Wood accepted the IPC's offer to make peace for the time being.[8]\nMore and more tourists flocked to the town and formed the majority of the population of Penacony. Unwilling to live by the rules set by the old townsfolk like Gopher Wood, they demanded to get involved in the town management every day. To maintain peace in Penacony, Gopher Wood stood his ground and rejected the request. The newcomers left disgruntled and started wreaking havoc in the streets. Realizing their efforts were in vain, the rebels decided to show Gopher Wood their might, which is known as the \"Dreamburn Riots.\"[8]\nThe rebels brought monsters from outside into the town, leaving the streets in pandemonium. The Bloodhound Family all rushed out to the streets to maintain order. The rebels \"sprinkled poison all over the flower fields\" (presumably referring to Sweet Dreams Troupe), causing the \"flowers\" to \"grow scary thorns\" (presumably referring to Dreamjolt Troupe) that started hurting the innocent. Maeven Ellis, Head of the Iris Family, put herself before the townsfolk. She tried awakening the \"unruly flowers\", but their thorns hurt her left eye. The Watchmaker hurried to the chaotic streets only to find everything ablaze.[8][9]\nAs nobody was guarding the The Reverie Hotel,[10][11] the rebels set the Hotel on fire. To rescue people in the Hotel, Gopher Wood entered the Hotel and his body was immolated. This historical event would be written as the play Night of Burning Dreams.[12] Without his physical body, Gopher Wood had to possess ravens or other Oak Family members to appear in public.[13]\nGopher Wood became a man of few words after the Dreamburn Riots. He stopped discussing Penacony's future with the Watchmaker anymore. Instead, he started implementing changes to the town alone. The Watchmaker reconnected with his old friends in other Family lineages, hoping to make them see Gopher Wood's mistake, but he got no support. The Watchmaker made his way to Dewlight Pavillion, hoping to have a chat with Gopher Wood, but Gopher Wood did not respond to the Watchmaker's confrontation.[8]\nThe Watchmaker returned to the abandoned Dreamflux Reef and revamped it with the help of Gallagher, Micah and Orla. Gopher Wood found out about Dreamflux Reef and issued the Watchmaker a warning. The population of Dreamflux Reef was growing, but Gopher Wood's influence kept encroaching the village's borders. Due to the worsening living conditions, many chose to return to Penacony. As the Watchmaker dug deeper into Penacony's secrets, he found out that Gopher Wood was stealing everyone's emotions to repair the collapsing Dreamscape.[8]\nThe Watchmaker came up with a great idea: they would organize a festival, using the \"Watchmaker's Legacy\" as a facade, and send invitations to the entire Cosmos to gather people and fight against The Family. He asked Gallagher to make sure to send an invitation to the Astral Express, so he can leave the true legacy for the Express. Gallagher would execute the plan during the Charmony Festival in the first year of 2158 AE.[14]\nSunday and Robin became orphans after a Stellaron descended upon their hometown. They were adopted by The Family when they came to help. Gopher Wood recognized their potential as \"twins of the Order\"[15] and brought them to Penacony.[3]\nIn Gopher Wood's plan, Robin was supposed to be the Chordmaster of the Charmony Festival in 2158 AE, so they could seize the power of the Harmony and resurrect Ena the Order by controlling Dominicus with the 107,336 souls of the Oak Family.[16]\nAfter Sunday succeeded the Oak Family Head, the ravens possessed by Gopher Wood acted as Sunday's Servant[17] to monitor the Dreamscape. After Acheron slashed Ten Stonehearts: Aventurine of Stratagems in Clock Studios Theme Park, Gopher Wood possessed other Family members to confront Acheron. He recognized her identity as a Self-Annihilator of Nihility and asked her to leave Penacony, and she followed his request.[18] Acheron judged that The Family wanted to avoid the risk from her because she's rarely affected by the power of other Paths but somehow she can unconsciously infiltrate The Family. Later, she shared this information with Black Swan, Dan Heng and Boothill on the Astral Express.[16]\nWhen Sunday and Robin met in Dreamflux Reef and learned that Gopher Wood was the suspect who employed the Stellaron's power, Robin gave up her role as the Chordmaster.[3] The twins and Welt confronted Gopher Wood in Golden Hour. During the negotiation, Gopher Wood asked Sunday to beseech THEM to cast THEIR light unto him and question him in THEIR stead, so that no lies may be concealed, and Sunday did as commanded. However, Welt pointed out that the Aeon Gopher Wood and Sunday both mentioned were not Xipe but Ena. As their secrets of the Order were exposed, Gopher Wood asked Sunday to put Welt and Robin to sleep.[1] However, Welt kept Aventurine's Token on himself, which was actually an IPC miniature transmitter to track the wielder's location or contact the wielder when needed. Before being put to sleep, Welt used the transmitter to send a message to the IPC.[3]\n3 system hours before the Charmony Festival began, Gopher Wood realized that Welt used the transmitter, so their secrets of the Order had spread like wildfire within The Family, and IPC starships were gathering towards Asdana. Then, Sunday betrayed Gopher Wood and was willing to sacrifice himself for Robin. Still, Sunday's betrayal was also part of Gopher Wood's plan. Sunday finally asked why Gopher Wood chose to bring the Order to Penacony instead of a desperate world. Gopher Wood answered that it's for justice and not to make the same mistake as the Harmony did. Sunday thought that Gopher Wood was not the one who manipulated the Dreamscape with the Stellaron, but Gopher Wood ended the conversation abruptly and died for unknown reason. Then, all of his possessed ravens collapsed and had no response.[16] After Ena's dream was shattered, The Family branch from the Montour System soon arrived and swiftly took control of the situation, and his death was officially confirmed.[19]\n"

It serves as the brain of operations when attached to the main body of the space station. On both sides of the master control zone and at its entrance is a huge wall consisting of numerous screens for surveillance. This system offers visuals on everything happening on the parameter of the space station with no blind spot. The system also boasts a sniper platform with roadblocks, capable of handling unknown threats, and a defense projection platform that can generate an anti-gravity shield over the space station. \nThe watcher zone is used to monitor the real-time status of the station's energy supply and the conditions of other zones. Together with the master control zone, these two areas form the core of the space station, offering an integrated system with strong capacities for observing, monitoring, defense, and attack. \nThe Base Zone is the core section between the two-stage structure separating the starship and the space station. It is the section where researchers partake in their primary daily activities. The reception center is located in the base zone, at the back of the space elevator. It is the first room to greet the station's visitors. Many people come here to see its splendor for themselves, but they are not allowed any further, and can only watch the proud researchers with admiration. The Medical Cabin is the medical facility and pride of the space station, said to be able to drag anyone back from the brink of death. Research projects in the station are always accompanied by unknown risks, and therefore the medical cabin is packed at all times.\nThe Storage Zone is used to house curios. Gigantic pathways can be found in the center, snaking through the upper and lower level rooms where different departments store their collections. The Gallery of Shadow is Madam Herta's personal gallery, sealed away all year round, and only Herta herself has access to entry. To the researchers, the gallery is no more than something to base their stories on, but it was opened by the Stellaron Hunters in order to place the Stellaron being stored there inside the Trailblazer during the Antimatter Legion attack.\nThe Supply Zone is the logistics hub of the space station. It has all manner of resources stored within its confines, supervises an energy core, and its equipped with a fully established railway platform. It stands as an essential junction for operations and maintenance aboard the space station. If things ever got out of hand and the master control zone was doomed to be destroyed, researchers would take the evacuation route and rush towards the supply zone, where all the external relief ships are docked along the Railway Platform.\nThe Seclusion Zone used to be a major research facility for cutting-edge experimentation, offering convenient conditions for high-risk experiments conducted between the shuttles, laboratories, and the greenhouse. The zone sealed off after Ruan Mei began to conduct her experiments, which resulted in a Swarm outbreak along with a clone of the Emanator of Propagation, Skaracabaz. The Trailblazer investigated this zone on Ruan Mei's behalf during one of her rare visits to the station, during which the clone emerged from the incubator and fought them. However, it died off after 56 seconds, unable to sustain its own existence. While the Swarm still has a small presence in the area, it is now primarily occupied by Ruan Mei's Creations, who mostly reside in the Breeding Ground and Pharmaceutical Room.\nThere are 2 Space Anchors in Master Control Zone:\nThere are 2 Space Anchors in Base Zone:\nThere are 4 Space Anchors in Storage Zone:\nThere are 3 Space Anchors in Supply Zone:\nThere are 4 Space Anchors in Seclusion Zone:\n4 Characters match the category selection:\nThere are 54 additional NPCs related to Herta Space Station:\nThere is 1 mentioned character related to Herta Space Station:\nThere are no upcoming NPCs related to Herta Space Station.\n"

Cyrille herself was an unremarkable child, but Cyrilla was a prodigy who passed the public service exam at age eleven and was chosen to become the next Supreme Guardian. During this time, many Architects visited the sisters' home, including the Minister of Internal Affairs, Stefan Marquez. Unlike the other adults, Stefan never ignored Cyrille and always treated her kindly. Cyrille started keeping a diary on his advice and mostly wrote about him. He comforted her when she learned that Cyrilla would be taken away by the adults and she might never see her again. He promised her that he wouldn't let that happen and gave her a blue stone as a symbol of their agreement.\nHowever, just when the Architects were about to relocate Cyrilla to Qlipoth Fort, she mysteriously disappeared. After days of searching without any success, the Architects wanted to begin the heir selection process anew, but Stefan strongly pushed for the instatement of Cyrille as the new Supreme Guardian, claiming that he had found Cyrille to be just as talented as Cyrilla and that they should appoint a new Supreme Guardian as soon as possible to avoid political instability after the previous Supreme Guardian's untimely death. The Architects finally agreed after heated internal debate.\nBut the Architects soon learned that Cyrille was an extremely mediocre child and inept in social situations. Stefan and his lackeys gained immense power over Qlipoth Fort and Belobog. Cyrille remained unquestionably loyal to Stefan, who told her to ignore those around her and listen only to him. He also claimed to be still searching for Cyrilla, but couldn't find her. The people grew increasingly angry with their puppet Supreme Guardian, and in the 14th year of her tenure, rebels within the Architects plotted a coup to overthrow Cyrille and Stefan. The rebels won over the Silvermane Guards' Captain and planned to lure the two of them to the Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone.[1]\nCyrille attended the military exercise there, but there was no trace of Stefan. A fake patrol of Silvermane Guards shoved Cyrille into an arsenal chest, took her to the far north of Belobog under the cover of darkness, and pushed the chest over a cliff. She seemed to have died thinking that she slipped into the chest. Cyrille's strong emotions become Echoes with the power of the Fragmentum, taking on human form. She lost her memories and was trapped with armillary box puzzles until the Trailblazer was able to bring her peace.\n"

        "content": "The High-Cloud Quintet was made up of five members from different Xianzhou ships:[3]\nUsing what he learned from his time with the Xianzhou, Yingxing forged four powerful weapons that came to be used by the other members of the Quintet.[7]\nIn their heyday, the High-Cloud Quintet were close friends and heroes of the Xianzhou. Jingliu, the Luofu's Sword Champion, recruited four other distinguished individuals; Imbibitor Lunae Dan Feng — High Elder of the Luofu Vidyadhara, Baiheng — an ace starskiff pilot from the most renowned of the Yaoqing's Foxian adventuring flying families known as the \"Starskiff Killer\", Yingxing — a short-life species craftsman who managed to attain the title of the Luofu's Furnace Master, and finally Jing Yuan — a Cloud Knight Lieutenant who was Jingliu's student, implied to be the last to join.[1]\nThey were initially gathered to save the Xianzhou Yuque from an assault by the Denizens of Abundance.[3][Note 2] Other feats that the Quintet accomplished in their short span included defeating the borisin at Thalassa, destroying the alliance between the Houyhnhnms and the wingweavers in the Abundance Axis, and defeating the living planet Ketu Mirage.[2]\nThe group came to an end more than 700 years before the main story,[Note 3] in Year 7379 Star Calendar,[9] when Baiheng sacrificed herself in a great battle against Shuhu. In an attempt to resurrect Baiheng, and also to solve the Vidyadharas' reproduction problem, Dan Feng committed a great sin that was known as the Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae.[3] Upset by the endless cycle of death that war brought about, he used the Transmutation Arcanum to resurrect Baiheng, while also allowing other races to be incorporated into the Vidyadhara species.[10] However, his tampering ended up creating an uncontrollable draconic abomination that wrought great destruction to Scalegorge Waterscape.[11]\nYingxing assisted Dan Feng in the resurrection process by using Shuhu's flesh, which backfired on him, transforming him into an immortal being struck with mara.[12] Jingliu also developed mara as a result of the incident, but it was likely induced by trauma as she was not involved in the resurrection.[13][Note 4] By using torn fabric from the edge of her skirt as a makeshift blindfold, Jingliu was able to keep her mara in check as she defeated the draconic beast.\nWhile Jing Yuan's involvement with the incident was minimal, he is said to have understood the \"price\" better than anyone, though he did not intervene.[14] One year after the Sedition, in Year 7380 Star Calendar, Jingliu fully succumbed to her mara and went on a murderous rampage until she was finally defeated by Jing Yuan.[15] Following this incident, she left the Xianzhou and her name was erased from the Luofu's public records, with the title of Sword Champion said to have been vacant since the Sedition.[4]\nAs a result of the Sedition, Bailu was chosen to be Dan Feng's successor as the next High Elder.[10] Dan Feng, meanwhile, was imprisoned and sentenced to a forced molting rebirth. His next incarnation, Dan Heng, was kept in the Shackling Prison for an unknown period of time, occasionally visited by Jing Yuan, before eventually being escorted out and exiled from the Luofu.[16][17][18][11]\nAfter Dan Heng's exile, he traveled across the universe, still only a teen (presumably by Vidyadhara rather than mortal standards).[19][Note 5] All the while, he was hunted by the person who used to be Yingxing,[20] who was determined to show him what the pain of death feels like as retribution for his past life's crimes.[16] Amidst Dan Heng's travels, he chanced on the Astral Express Crew, incidentally saving them by defeating huge monsters in the path of the Express. Himeko offered to take him in under the guise of being the train's guard and archivist.[21] While Dan Heng has managed to kill Blade and escape many times over,[22] he still lives in fear of him, having nightmares about his endless pursuit.[23]\nAfter Yingxing's transformation, he left the Xianzhou, presumably through exile, as he was considered a wanted criminal aboard the ship. For an unknown period of time, he was taught swordsmanship by Jingliu and was also killed by her a hundred times over.[12] Following this, he pursued Dan Heng across the cosmos, always fighting him every time they met. He came to forget his name,[24] abandoning his previous identity and growing progressively more disheveled until he was found by the Stellaron Hunters some centuries later and persuaded by Sam and Kafka to join them.[25] While he still seemingly considers himself to be unnamed,[26] Kafka took his new identity as a blade literally, referring to him as \"Bladie\" from their first meeting and effectively treating it as his name,[27] something he was apparently amenable to and allowed others to follow suit in (though only without the diminutive nickname).[28]\nAfter the Sedition, and the exiles of Jingliu and Yingxing, Jing Yuan was named the Arbiter-General of the Luofu Cloud Knights, a position he still holds today. He took on a disciple, Yanqing, who was named a Cloud Knight Lieutenant in Year 8096 Star Calendar, much like Jing Yuan was in the days of the High-Cloud Quintet.[15] He also takes it upon himself to check up on Bailu occasionally, faking illnesses as an excuse to visit her, asking after her health and of any dreams she's had recently.[29]\nIn Year 8100 Star Calendar, after a Stellaron was smuggled onto the Xianzhou Luofu, Blade and the other Stellaron Hunters boarded the ship in pursuit of it. Blade was captured by the Cloud Knights and brought to the Shackling Prison to be interrogated by Jing Yuan, but managed to escape at a later time. The Astral Express Crew eventually boarded the Luofu in order to resolve the Stellaron crisis and clear the Stellaron Hunters' name of any involvement. Despite Dan Heng's banishment from the ship, he decided to tail his companions out of concern for their well-being.[30]\nOnce aboard the Luofu, Dan Heng traveled with Sushang, a Cloud Knight transferee, and Luocha, a traveling merchant in the hopes of reuniting with his friends. When they reached the Alchemy Commission, Dan Heng slipped away from the others and boarded a starskiff to Scalegorge Waterscape. There, he encountered Kafka and Blade, though his confrontation with the latter was interrupted by Yanqing. Blade proceeded to reveal Dan Heng's true identity as Imbibitor Lunae by stabbing him in the chest. When Yanqing tried to capture both of them, Blade and Dan Heng briefly fought side-by-side to defeat him.[16]\nAfter the fight ended, Jing Yuan appeared and dismissed the Stellaron Hunters. He and Dan Heng continued deeper into the delve to meet up with the Astral Express Crew. Calling upon his powers from his previous incarnation, Dan Heng parted the waters of Scalegorge Waterscape to clear a path to the roots of the Ambrosial Arbor. After removing the seals on the Arbor, the group confronted Lord Ravager Phantylia. Dan Heng and Jing Yuan managed to defeat her vessel by coordinating their attacks, with the powers of Dan Heng's Cloudhymn Roar and Jing Yuan's Lightning Lord, though Jing Yuan was injured in the battle and had to spend time away from his duties to recuperate. During his leave of absence, he appointed Master Diviner Fu Xuan to temporarily take on his responsibilities.[31]\nDue to Dan Heng's part in resolving the Stellaron crisis, Jing Yuan revoked his banishment decree, allowing him to come and go freely on the Luofu.[31] Dan Heng later met with the Luofu's current High Elder, Bailu, and together they repaired the seal on the Ambrosial Arbor.[10]\nSome time later, Jingliu arrived on the Luofu and turned herself in to the Cloud Knights for arrest, but requested one day of freedom before her trial. She sent an anonymous letter to Dan Heng, who went to the Seat of Divine Foresight with the intention of asking Jing Yuan about it, but instead encountered Jingliu. The two of them, accompanied by Yanqing, who was ordered to keep an eye on them, first visited Stargazer Navalia. Jingliu revealed that the reason she wanted to come to this area was to pay tribute to Baiheng with a soul-soothing ceremony.[12]\nAfter manufacturing a starskiff and sending it off to the stars with Baiheng's flagon, the trio passed through the Artisanship and Alchemy Commissions. They then met with Jing Yuan and Blade at Scalegorge Waterscape, where the general was interrogating Luocha's involvement in the Stellaron crisis. Yanqing escorted Luocha away, leaving the High-Cloud Quintet members alone.\nAccording to Jingliu, the members of the Quintet all made a promise to each other 700 years ago — that no matter what happened, the five of them would always gather at Scalegorge Waterscape and share a drink. Jingliu reflected on the group's unhappy fate, reiterating that \"Of five people, three must pay the price,\" and musing in what specific ways each person will pay their price: Dan Heng will forever bear the shadow and sins of his past self, Blade will experience only murder and his own death for the rest of his life, and Jingliu will face the punishment of the Xianzhou Alliance before \"paying an even worse price.\" She then bid the High-Cloud Quintet a final farewell.\nBefore she left, Jingliu fulfilled Blade's promise of one last attempt to end his life. They dueled, with Jingliu emerging victorious once again, and everyone went their separate ways.[12]\nFour members of the Quintet used weapons forged by Yingxing, which were his most famous creations:[7]\n"

        "session_name": "borisin",
        "url": "https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com//wiki/Borisin",
        "content": "The borisin share a common ancestor with the Foxians, yet the two have diverged onto very different paths. Foxian epics tell how the races were divinely inspired by a Lord of Longevity from beyond the stars. Drinking from the Redspring, they were granted immortality. But later historical developments saw the borisin consider the Foxians as slaves or cannon fodder, fueling their desire to conquer the stars.[1]\nAccording to borisin folk songs, their first Warhead, Duran, obtained immortality from the dew of a tree guarded by Foxians tasked by Yaoshi to protect it. The song claims that Yaoshi only blessed the strong and used the Foxians as a test. After Duran and the beast, Taowu, slaughtered the Foxians, Duran asked Yaoshi to bless the borisin with immortality. However this narrative is a fictional myth created by the borisin to justify their enslavement of the Foxians and to solidify their racial identity through worship of Yaoshi. Yaoshi does not bless only the strong and it is evident that the borisin interpret \"Abundance\" based on their own cultural norms and values.[3]\nThe borisin have a distinct canine anatomical structure: Broad, lean skeletons; powerful jaws and neck muscles; well-developed canine fangs; pointed beast-like ears atop the skull; and sharp claws on hand and foot. Some borisin have large and fluffy tails while others have short and thin tails. The borisin worship the concept of a strong body, seeing strong physique as a blessing from the gods. The wingweaver Xili implied that Foxians on the Xianzhou Zhuming look similar to borisin.[4] Within the broad classification of long-life species, the borisin can be said to have the greatest healing ability. Alongside this hyper-healing is their ability to shapeshift, known as \"Moon Rage.\" This ability has also been observed very rarely in some Foxians, apart from the Foxians of the Yaoqing.[1] The Yaoqing Foxians are said to be genetically similar to the borisin.[5]\nThe Eclipse borisin are able to consume the flesh of their enemies, allowing their bodies to quickly mutate and enhance itself. \nShapeshifting is accompanied by intense hyperplasia of the bone and muscle structure, such as a protruded snout and jawline, and the twisting in of the foot structure. This damaging deformation process is eventually completely restored by the borisin's rapid healing ability. During battle, the borisin emit a pheromone known as Lupitoxin, which stimulates fear in the amygdala. To counteract these effects, the Cloud Knights either have to wear a breathing mask with filters that can resist it, or consume a poison-proof pellet.[1] When the livers of borisin are removed, it was found that they turned into a huge, aggressive \"cancerous mass\" within a few hours.[6] The coloration of their blood is pitch-black.[7]\nBorisin tissues can be implanted into machinery, as shown with the Howling Casket, a combat machine built by the Intelligentsia Guild which is supplemented by borisin tissue. These combat machines are capable of utilizing Moon Rage and can even put their kin in a frenzy faster.\nBorisin fur can be used to create strong rope.\nThe borisin are masters of biotechnology, and use it to manufacture weapons, armor, and spaceships, as well as modify their own bodies. Their weapons and armor have some characteristics of living beings, while their spaceships, called mechabeasts or beast ships, are living beings with the ability to feed, attack, and reproduce.[1] They have been known to enslave and modify members of other intelligent races to attack and plunder planets.[2]\nWith the Redspring as a medium, everything that the borisin needed was made from this miraculous source. The fields no longer grew grain but viscorpi instead, and borisin garments were no longer of linen or fabric but of embryonic flesh. Even the chilly snowlands that once terrified The Old Verdant Home civilizations were no longer a concern, for the borisin cultivated biological membranes in the polar regions to craft into warm dome-shaped tents, blocking the Lupuswinter beyond this barrier.[8] Their birdles use neural spike whips to stun and tame mechabeasts.[9]\nThe Chiseltooth Pack's genetic shamans produce nearly all of the borisins' biotechnology, while the Bloodwind Pack have the largest fleet of the main packs. Unlike the other packs, the Rhinohound Pack do not rely on biotechnology, but instead take more interest in industrial technology. During their coming of age ceremony, Rhinohound pack members are given a set of exoskeleton resembling a divine beast from borisin lore.\nMok Tok's pack was shown to take a pill that allowed them to assume the forms of Xianzhou Natives or Foxians, though it is not known if they made it themselves. The pill was potent enough that it could visually trick people, but a keen Foxian could see through the disguise with their sense of smell.\nThe borisin have a tribal council system, and have a culture that reveres strength and preying on the weak. A single tribe is called a \"Pack,\" while a coalition of tribes is called a \"Great Pack.\" The leader of a Pack is called a Brood Lord, typically the strongest and most cunning among them. In a Great Pack, the Brood Lords of each pack fight each other and are ranked based on strength, with the strongest of them being called the \"Father Wolf\" or \"Warhead\". The Warhead is both the spiritual leader and the strongest warrior of the tribe, commanding its tide-like army, and dominating life and death on the battlefield.[1] It is borisin tradition for the chief's partner to act as the leader of all officials.[10]\nAn unknown rank among the borisin is Great Erkhan, also known as a top military officer.[11]\nThe borisin despise settled civilizations and roam the galaxy bringing all-consuming war with them. Their harsh beliefs in survival compel them to fight incessantly and devote themselves to a life of bloodshed and conquest. The former Warhead, Hoolay, took pride and joy in ravaging other civilizations. In order to surpass former leaders, the new Warhead had to lead his soldiers on an expedition in order to make a name for himself and affirm his position in the tribe. When put on trial by the Ten-Lord Commission, Hoolay was confused by the sentence, as he saw his crimes as nothing more than him following the laws of survival.[7] Borisin who choose to lead non-violent lives generally looked at with disdain, though they are all equally vital to borisin culture.[12][11]\nDespite this, some borisin view \"strength\" as not just meaning physical strength, as Dr. Zongguang remarked that a physically strong borisin would not dare mock a frail but genius poet without careful consideration, lest they be shunned due to \"disrespecting the strong.\" Zongguang also noted that on the planet Pisdo, Chiliyan and fourteen other people rose from war slaves to positions of power, indicating that borisin place more importance on capability than birthright. He also notes that due to borisin valuing strength, they would always be at their best, not slacking off or relaxing from their previous successes.[11]\nWell-trained sorya don jellyfish-like membranous armor under the leadership of a yonda. They then board the beast ships that can warp between stars, explore different worlds, and swear in the name of Duran and the Yaoshi to make the stars into their herding ground.[9]\nWhile borisin look at Foxians with disdain, a unique outlier is the Whitewolf Pack, which is not led by borisin but instead by Foxians. These were former slaves who revolted against their borisin masters following Hoolay's capture, and the borisin were unable to quell the rebellion. It is implied that they were eventually accepted, though most of the borisin outright fear the Whitewolf Pack foxians due to their savagery and ruthlessness.[11]\nAccording to information complied by the scouts of the Verdantia Fleet, there are currently six major borisin packs. The authors of the Yaoqing Recruit Handbook: Borisin Pack Overview acknowledge that there are other borisin packs that they have not identified.[13]\nWhen the dual rising moons meet, and the night sky is at its brightest, the voodoo masters of the hunting tribe gift bridles to the children of Duran to symbolize them entering adulthood. This blank bridle would become a book that records the history of their battles throughout their lives. These were the reins, shackles, and whips. The first thing taught to borisin youths who had grown taller than war beasts' legs was to always grasp the reins tight in their hands, or else the youths themselves would become enslaved livestock — or worse, become feed.\nAs soon as the adulthood ceremony ends, the borisin youths must walk into the weapon farm, then pick and tame their first battle mount among the \"mechabeasts\" that have been filtered and bred via gene witchcraft. Mechabeasts that consume the conquered as their feed have astounding agility, perception, and ferocity. On that night, borisin youths must chase and duel against the mechabeasts. Dying to the beasts is considered the result of cowardice.\nSome will kill their peers, which is considered the law of how the beasts shall be distributed. The borisin youths trip the desired mount to the ground and tie the bridle, which is inlaid with neural spike whips, onto the animal's neck. The beast will be stunned through telepathy with its future master and become as tame as if they already received hundreds of whiplashes. When the beast willingly carries the master on its back, the youth is considered a full-fledged borisin sorya.\nThen, the borisin bridle will become the recorder of wars, and the reins will gradually become full of scratches, knots, and accessories. On the bridle, light scratches indicate how many enemies the owner had slain, knots record how many major campaigns they were involved in, and the accessories dangling from the reins are loot such as human teeth and Intellitron cores obtained from pillaging frenzies. They are considered medals for borisin individuals to demonstrate their strength.\nWhen the mounts beneath the warrior perish in warfare, or when borisin wish to mete out punishment, the bridle can also be fastened around the bodies of other living beings. Their targets are usually foxians. Whenever rare war-like individuals emerge among the foxians, the master of the wolf-head would prioritize binding these foxians with the bridles, driving them as war slaves to serve as vanguards on the battlefield.\nIf all slaves are dead, and the weapons are bent, then the bridle can still act as a whip if one attaches a spike to the end. If the bridle is snapped and the warrior perishes in war with their fangs and claws shattered, then the bridle will become the sole remaining epitaph and memories for borisin.[9]\nThe borisin language had heard several times without the interference of the Synesthesia Beacon translation. Foxians enslaved by the borisin also spoke the language.[15] Some of the words' meanings have been translated:\nBoth the foxians and borisins came from the Verdantia, the \"Planet of Verdant\". The foxians inhabited the riverlands while the borisins were herders who inhabited the grasslands. The foxians saw the borisins as savage while the borisins saw the foxians as deceptive merchants. Despite their animosity, they cooperated with each other during the extreme climates of the \"Vulpesummer\" and \"Lupuswinter\". In the summer, they would set down their weapons for the rich harvests, but during the winter there would be unceasing conflict due to hunger.[9]\nOne Lupuswinter lasted far longer than usual, causing mass starvation. A prophet saw the end of the world and made a wish to Yaoshi for sustenance. This person is known as lady Tushan in foxian legends while the borisins believe it was a man named Duran. Yaoshi split the mountains and the divine nectar of the Redspring poured forth. Those who drank from the Redspring gained vitality and strength from the meat of beasts they ate. Their bodies became increasingly bestial. The Redspring transformed the the Planet of Verdant, which experienced a population explosion and ecological collapse. The canine races prayed to Yaoshi for help but THEY did not respond. As a result, the borisins and foxians left for space. The borisins became spacefaring conquerors who brought the \"Lupuswinter\" to other planets.[9]\nUnder the borisin, the Denizens of Abundance were involved with three large-scale wars with the Xianzhou Alliance. The borisin once invaded Thalassa but driven out by the High-Cloud Quintet of the Xianzhou Alliance. After the capture and imprisonment of the Abundance Axis's last Warhead, Hoolay, the coalition has greatly declined in strength,[2] and the borisin political landscape was plunged into a state of extreme instability.\nAt some point, the Brood Lord Aksin lead his hunting pack into the Echidna skywall, struggling to fight off the hostile Shepherds Fleet. Their fleet consisted of 16 beast ships and 325 battleships. The Xianzhou Yuque planned to observe the borisin's internal war and send out a battle report afterward.[14]\nIn 7900 Star Calendar, the Cloudpeer Telescope detected Reignbow Arbiter's manifestation at three coordinates in the Consternation Starzone: The Yadav variable star; the Cerulean Nightmare; and the Knucklebone. It was predicted to be plagued and the Cloud Knights' Rainbowfall Fleet successfully dealt with the borisin Bluefang Pack who had plundered everything.[20]\nIn the year 7992 Star Calendar, Yewliho was born into a Bloodwind Pack beast ship operator family. The Bloodwind Pack \"inspired awe across the universe\" with their gigantic fleet of beast ships. Within a society like borisin that honors strength above all, beast ship operators from this generation, like Yewliho, naturally held a relatively high level of political influence.[10]\nBy 8023 Star Calendar, Yewliho already had her own personal fleet, the \"Preta,\" at only age 31. She had already independently planned and completed dozens of plunder and ransack missions. As far as Xianzhou pilots at the time were concerned, Yewliho was an unparalleled nightmare. She was renowned for her fearless attacks and many schemes, and could be said to lead the most brutal and efficient fleet at that time. \nBefore long, thanks to her many military exploits, Yewliho's rank among the pack skyrocketed. In 8025 Star Calendar, Yewliho and the Bloodwind Pack Chief Hosing Khan were married. As it is borisin tradition for the chief's partner to act as the leader of all officials, Yewliho had suddenly risen to the second-highest rank within the Bloodwind Pack. In 8032 Star Calendar, Yewliho gave birth to a child named \"Cherluwoo.\" If everything went as planned, Cherluwoo would become the next leader of the pack. However, there was an unexpected development the year that Cherluwoo turned 5.\nOriginally, Hosing Khan had already exceeded 400 years of age without bearing an heir. If the regular route of succession were to be followed, the title of chief would go to the next \"Duran descendant\"... Hosing Khan's nephew, Kobo. However, the birth of Cherluwoo had shattered this plan. After having prepared all his life to inherit the pack, Kobo led the 3,000-strong beast ship fleet that had sworn loyalty to him to reclaim his power and attacked the chief's great beast ship. Hosing Khan had no time to react before he was murdered by his bodyguards that Kobo had bribed. Naturally, Kobo's next targets would be Yewliho and her son.\nFortunately, Yewliho had always retained her own fleet that vowed loyalty to her, the Preta. Although they only boasted 300 ships, every member was a trusted ally that had accompanied her on pillages for many years. Yewliho and her fleet successfully forced their way out of Kobo's encirclement. However, with the huge beast ship fleet that pursued them like locusts, there was no way for her mere 300 ships to escape. However, \"Kobo Khan\" called off his manhunt a short while later and returned to the Bloodwind Pack, successfully becoming the next chief. Yewliho would never say how she managed to escape that lethal pursuit, it is only known that her only child, Cherluwoo, died during that escape.\nIn the year 8038 Star Calendar, Yewliho led the Preta (with 127 men remaining) to the Fanghu, determined to submit and pledge allegiance to the Alliance. After two long years of careful deliberation, the Alliance decided to pardon these borisin for their crimes and allow them to live inside the Fanghu under strict surveillance. This was on the condition that they comply with all Alliance research on borisin, as well as submitting all beast ship-related technology to them. This was also the time that Zongguang met Yewliho. As a cultural anthropologist, they were ordered to interview these 127 borisin, in order to deepen the Xianzhou's understanding of borisin society.\nThroughout the course of her research, Yewliho and Zongguang developed a deep friendship. She was an intelligent, frank, and courageous warrior who was able to summarize the complex and chaotic world of borisin society and logic to Zongguang in concise, clear language. Likely because of her hatred towards Kobo, Yewliho always hoped that she would be able to lead her Preta to fight for the Alliance. However, a request like this was unlikely to receive approval. Yewliho made this request again and again and was rejected every time. After 30 years, she could bear this cycle no longer and began to seek Zongguang's assistance.\nThey suggested that she write a long letter explaining her life and background in detail. This would allow her to explain her hatred of her enemies to the Seven Arbiter-Generals and why she longs to fight for the Alliance. When she did this, Zongguang would be willing to put their personal reputation on the line to vouch for her. Two years later, Yewliho wrote My Return to the Path.\nDuring the Third Abundance War of 8072, the Denizens of Abundance had assembled again with revival of Ketu Mirage, the roaming star. The borisins invaded the Xianzhou Fanghu and were nearly successful in winning the battle. With the Fanghu serving as the main battleground, it quickly descended into a terrifying bloodbath. Pressed with their backs up against the wall, no one was free to keep watch over Yewliho. So, without receiving permission from the Alliance, the Preta launched their final assault.\nIt is unknown just how many Abominations of Abundance the Preta wiped out in the war. However, they managed to transport at least 4,000 civilians to safety. Just as the Xianzhou faced defeat, the Reignbow Arbiter descended onto the physical plane and annihilated the Borisins' fleet using THEIR Lux Arrow. And during this process, all 127 borisin warriors of the Preta, including Yewliho perished.[10]\nReports from the Xianzhou Yaoqing revealed that Phantylia, taking on the guise \"Mangas\", was organizing the borisin groups into larger packs following her defeat at Scalegorge Waterscape, who believed that she would bring them back to greatness. A large pack of borisin, led by Mok Tok, infiltrated the Xianzhou Luofu to break Hoolay out from prison, taking on the appearance of Xianzhou natives or Foxians through a unique pill that allowed them to get through undetected. Due to various concerns about Jing Yuan's conduct, Feixiao was sent to the Luofu to pick up Hoolay so he could be moved to The Xianzhou Yaoqing. Aware of an IPC transport carrying borisin-infused machinery, several borisin attacked the ship to force it to seek shelter in the Xianzhou Luofu, knowing that its contents would have to be inspected.\nLed by Mok Tok, the borisin were able to infiltrate The Shackling Prison while also gaining the assistance of mara-struck soldiers. They were successful in freeing Hoolay and escaped the prison, though the Alliance was able to hunt them down, resulting in the group's demise and Hoolay's death by Feixiao.\n"

        "content": "After the Vidyadhara joined the Xianzhou Alliance, the entire delve of Scalegorge Waterscape on the Luofu was said to have been brought over from their home world, including the waters of the Lunarescent Depths. In the Year 4800 Star Calendar, the five lineages of the Vidyadhara made an alliance on the Yuque, putting their sacred vow into writing: \"This oath shall remain unbroken, standing stronger than even earth and steel.\"[1] The five High Elders were bound to keep watch over the respective plaguemarks of each Xianzhou ship. To accomplish this, Imbibitor Lunae Yubie, High Elder of the Luofu at the time, made a decision to move the entire delve of Scalegorge Waterscape underwater to help the Luofu seal the Ambrosial Arbor. The Xianzhou natives felt they owed the Vidyadhara a great debt for this, while some Vidyadhara, including Imbibitor Lunae, saw it as repayment for giving them a home on the Luofu.[2][3]\nDan Feng, the most recent Imbibitor Lunae, joined the High-Cloud Quintet and together they accomplished many feats: drove out the Borisin invading Thalassa, destroyed the alliance between the Houyhnhnms and Wingweavers in the Abundance Axis, rescued the Xianzhou Yuque and defeated the living planet Ketu Mirage, becoming one of the most prolific Vidyadhara of his time.[4]\nHowever, approximately a hundred years later, the High-Cloud Quintet would fall apart, and sometime after, in the Year 7379 Star Calendar, Dan Feng would go on to commit a great crime. This would spark turmoil and be considered an act of rebellion against the Xianzhou Luofu and the event would be known as the Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae, a stain on Vidyadhara history. Upset by the endless cycle of death that war brought about, he used the Transmutation Arcanum to resurrect Baiheng, who sacrificed herself in a great battle against Shuhu, while also allowing other races to be incorporated into the Vidyadhara species in order to solve the Vidyadhara reproduction problem.[5] His tampering instead ended up creating an uncontrolled draconic abomination that wrought great destruction to the Scalegorge Waterscape and the creation of Bailu.[6] The Luofu Vidyadhara were divided on the matter: there were those who sided with Dan Feng and those who sided with the Xianzhou. It was a controversial time of great unrest.[7]\nWith the Transmutation Arcanum in his possession, Dan Feng was able to personally perform the ritual to name a new High Elder of the Luofu, and he selected the Vidyadhara who would be reborn as Bailu. However, the ritual failed, and as a result Dan Feng's power was splintered between Bailu and his next reincarnation, Dan Heng.[5] Lady Bailu was selected to become the next Imbibitor Lunae, though she did not possess the same level of power as previous High Elders and the power of dragon transmutation was not passed on intact, as the Transmutation Arcanum had not been carried out in full, resulting in her gaining only a fraction her predecessor's power.[2][8] In order to prevent a similar predicament, Yunyou, attendant to the young High Elder, Bailu, commissioned some of the finest craftsmen to create the Dragonhorn Pilory to shackle the latter's tail in order to limit her powers.\nThe Cloud Knights joined forces with the Vidyadhara Preceptors to assault him, and Dan Feng was captured and his punishment was carried out; he went through torture and hatching rebirth and his subsequent incarnation was held in the Shackling Prison for a period of time before being exiled from the Luofu. After Dan Heng’s exile, he traveled across the universe, still only a teen (presumably by Vidyadhara rather than mortal standards).[9][Note 1] Amidst Dan Heng's travels, he chanced on the Astral Express Crew, incidentally saving them by defeating huge monsters in the path of the Express. Himeko offered to take him in under the guise of being the train's guard and archivist.[10] In Year 8100 Star Calendar, after a Stellaron was smuggled onto the Xianzhou Luofu, the Astral Express Crew eventually boarded the ship in order to help resolve the Stellaron crisis and clear the Stellaron Hunters' name of any involvement. Despite Dan Heng's banishment from the ship, he decided to tail his companions out of concern for their well-being.[11]\nOnce aboard the Luofu, Dan Heng traveled with Sushang, a Cloud Knight transferee, and Luocha, a traveling merchant in the hopes of reuniting with his friends. When they reached the Alchemy Commission, Dan Heng slipped away from the others and boarded a starskiff to Scalegorge Waterscape. There, he encountered Kafka and Blade, though his confrontation with the latter was interrupted by Yanqing. Blade proceeded to reveal Dan Heng's true identity as Imbibitor Lunae by stabbing him in the chest. When Yanqing tried to capture both of them, Blade and Dan Heng briefly fought side-by-side to defeat him.[12]\nAfter the fight ended, Jing Yuan appeared and dismissed the Stellaron Hunters. He and Dan Heng continued deeper into the delve to meet up with the Astral Express Crew. Calling upon his powers from his previous incarnation, Dan Heng parted the waters of Scalegorge Waterscape to clear a path to the roots of the Ambrosial Arbor. After removing the seals on the Arbor, the group confronted Lord Ravager Phantylia. Dan Heng and Jing Yuan managed to defeat her vessel by coordinating their attacks, with the powers of Dan Heng's Cloudhymn Roar and Jing Yuan's Lightning Lord, though Jing Yuan was injured in the battle and had to spend time away from his duties to recuperate.[13]\nDue to Dan Heng's part in resolving the Stellaron crisis, Jing Yuan revoked his banishment decree, allowing him to come and go freely on the Luofu.[13] Dan Heng later met with the Luofu's current High Elder, Bailu, and together they repaired the seal on the Ambrosial Arbor. Dan Heng met with Huanxi, one of Bailu's maids, who urged him not to meet her and instead meet with the Preceptor elders in order to take up the position of High Elder, claiming she did not want Bailu to take on the burden. Luying, a Vidyadhara alchemist from the Alchemy Commission, expressed a different sentiment to Dan Heng, fearing that he would threaten Bailu's position as High Elder, and asked him to leave the Luofu as they were making their way to the starskiff dock. At the Alchemy Commission, they came across General Jing Yuan, who was still recuperating. He gave them some advice before they left, where they were set upon by Vidyadhara assassins just as they met with Huanxi at the docks. After Dan Heng swiftly dispatched the assailants, they group made their way to Scalegorge Waterscape where they met Bailu and exchanged pleasantries. Both Dan Heng and Bailu expressed their disinterest in the High Elder position before proceeding down towards the Dragon Palace.\nThere, Dan Heng tried repairing the seal but to no avail. Bailu, following his example, started to affect the seal. By working together and combining their powers, they successfully managed to strengthen the Arbor's seal, proving that Bailu did inherit some of Dan Feng's power through the Transmutation Arcanum. However, they were soon ambushed by more assassins concealed by cloudhymn magic. After they defeated the attackers, they discovered there were more concealed enemies looking for them. Dan Heng used mirage echolocation using the various mirage echoes lingering in the ruined Palace to detect and avoid the assassins. While conversing with the echoes, they learned more about the true nature of Dan Feng's crime.\nThe group managed to reach the surface and met with Huanxi, who declared that she was worried about Bailu, as she had been attacked by assassins. After being questioned about how she knew about the assassins and how they were targeting Bailu, Huanxi revealed herself to be among their ranks and attacked the group with her fellow assassins. In the heat of battle, Jing Yuan joined the fight and assisted them in defeating the remaining assailants. Jing Yuan questions the Preceptors' motives, while Huanxi denied their involvement, insisting that she acted alone. She died before Jing Yuan could bring her in for further questioning. Dan Heng and Bailu reflected on what they learned. Dan Heng observed that while he had inherited Dan Feng's more combat-oriented and destructive abilities, Bailu inherited all of his healing and restorative abilities. Bailu posed that Dan Heng might have been the teacher that she had always needed, and that they might have been friends or disciples in their previous lives. Dan Heng revealed that his worries about Bailu had been assuaged by the Preceptors and that she always possessed true power. Regarding her healing abilities, Bailu assured Dan Heng that Dan Feng might have had a gentle side to him as well, before they both bid each other farewell.[5]\n"

Due to circumstances that led to the Quintet's dissolution, he was charged guilty of one of the Xianzhou's \"ten unpardonable sins\" and sentenced to imprisonment in the Shackling Prison, where he was forced to undergo molting rebirth and eternal banishment.\nDuring Dan Feng's time in the Quintet, he served as both a healer and cloudhymn sorcerer. His signature weapon was Cloud-Piercer, a weapon crafted by fellow Quintet member Yingxing.[3] He was shown to be close with the other Quintet members, and would regularly drink and spar with them.[4][5] At some point, Dan Feng allowed Yingxing into the Dragon Palace at Scalegorge Waterscape, a sacred ground for the Vidyadhara, to repay a favor.[6]\nDuring battle, Dan Feng would seek his comrades' whereabouts and use them as grounding anchors, despite his draconic power dulling mortal empathy when in use.[7] According to Jing Yuan, many saw Dan Feng only for his immense power, not as a person \"with feelings and emotions.\"[8]\nIn the Year 7379 of the Star Calendar,[5] in an event that later came to be known as the \"Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae,\" Dan Feng caused turmoil by using Shuhu's flesh and invoking the Transmutation Arcanum,[4] breaking the foremost of ten unpardonable sins on the Xianzhou with the help of Yingxing.[9] It is implied that this was in the aftermath of a devastating war against Shuhu, an Emanator of Yaoshi, where fellow Quintet member Baiheng lost her life.[10] Their tampering with the Ambrosial Arbor caused the creation of an abhorrent beast, and for Yingxing to somehow become immortal and struck with mara.[9] This caused Yingxing, now Blade, to harbor an immense resentment for Dan Feng, and in turn, his reincarnation.[11]\nWith the Transmutation Arcanum in his possession, Dan Feng was able to personally perform the ritual to name a new Vidyadhara High Elder of the Luofu, and he selected the Vidyadhara who would be reborn as Bailu. However the ritual failed, and as a result Dan Feng's power was splintered between Bailu and his next reincarnation, Dan Heng. The draconic abomination that would eventually become Bailu also wreaked great destruction on Scalegorge Waterscape, which the remaining members of the Quintet were forced to put down, resulting in damage to the seals, 12 Preceptors, 253 Pearlkeepers, and 116 alchemists and healers being wounded. 1285 Vidyadhara completely perished in this disaster, and over 3000 were still missing at the time of the incident.[12]\nDuring his imprisonment, Dan Feng was chained and tortured.[4] He eventually went through molting rebirth, the process of Vidyadhara reincarnation, which involved the Preceptors using an exuviation charm against his will.[13] After his rebirth, the newly born Dan Heng was held in the Shackling Prison for an indeterminate amount of time before being exiled — a lighter sentence, negotiated by Jing Yuan, than what both the Vidyadhara Preceptors and Ten-Lords Commission wanted for him.[14][15]\nIn the aftermath of the Sedition, Dan Feng became a sort of legend among Xianzhou storytellers — and even after his passing, many Vidyadhara still worshipped him in secret. There were several dramas and literary works made about the Sedition from the perspective of supporters, which caused groups to form that stood against the Alliance. It was said that the Seat of Divine Foresight originally allowed the works, and only sought to remove them after rebellious groups formed against the government.[16]\n"

He manages the Robot Settlement and acts with the ultimate goal of preserving the Underworld — relying only on his calculations and paying little attention to human concerns.\nSvarog is a tall, dark blue mech with a glowing pink cyclopean eye. He wears black pants and shoes as well as a fur jacket with multiple openings that expose his shoulders.\nAs a robot, Svarog does not convey emotions nor does he trust humans, believing them to be unpredictable and dangerous. The lone exception is Clara, who he treats as his daughter and protects her in battle. He's highly calculating, ensuring that all of his decisions are the right course of action to protect humanity, despising conflicts such ones that arise from Wildfire and the Vagrants. According to Clara, \"preservation\" is his responsibility, so he in turn longs for peace and coexistence.\nSvarog is an ancient mech which was reactivated by Clara sometime before the events of the game. Seeing her cry caused Svarog to take her in as his adopted daughter, and he would try to locate her real family despite her insistence otherwise.\nHe began playing a more active role in managing the Underworld after the Silvermane Guards sealed off the Underworld and took control of all the ownerless robots. Claiming to be a \"guardian of humanity,\" Svarog and his forces occupied the Furnace Core hub to stop any threats coming from the Overworld and the Underworlders from leaving, believing that the Underworlders were not strong enough to handle the threat of Fragmentum in the Overworld. He also notably refused to negotiate with Wildfire, deeming them to be a threat.\nAfter a large Geomarrow vein was discovered in the Underworld, the miners of Boulder Town and various vagrants began fighting over it. Svarog accompanied Clara to the vein in the Great Mine and had his forces scatter the groups. Seeing the Trailblazer, Dan Heng and March 7th prompted him to leave to protect the Furnace Core due to external variables. \nThe Astral Express, who sought to save the world from the Stellaron disaster, needed Svarog's help in obtaining information regarding it. They were able to convince Clara to grant an audience with him, but during negotiations, the mention of the word caused him to consider them high-level threats and attack them. He was eventually defeated, and after being repaired, allowed them to access files relating to it after considering the outsiders' presence and Clara's request.[4] Eventually, following Cocolia's death and Bronya succeeding her, Svarog considered his first mission — protecting the Underworld, complete.[5]\nLuka would eventually challenge Svarog to a duel to see his standing as an Underworld fighter, which he accepted. Svarog held back during the fight, but was impressed by Luka's performance, stating that he would remember it and would re-evaluate his stance on humanity's limits.[6]\nWhen an automaton named Pascal began stealing parts and other automatons began attacking it, Svarog deduced that because it had been repairing itself with Fragmentum-contaminated materials, the automatons in the base network had likewise considered it a threat. Due to this, Svarog suggested that he format and integrate Pascal's data into the base network, though it would remove its emotional intelligence. Clara instead suggested placing a \"lock\" on Pascal, clearing redundant data and making sure that it would not harm people. Regardless of the Trailblazer's decision, Svarog honors their request and follows their advice.[7]\nWhen Topaz arrives to Jarilo-VI to claim it for the Interastral Peace Corporation, she meets Svarog and Clara in his base. Aware of her identity and motives, Svarog learns from her that she is looking for the automatons in the Old Weapon Testing Ground left behind by the organization 700 years ago. He agrees to help her as he calculates a high chance of compliance via force if he refused and could sense she wanted to help the planet. No conflict happens between Svarog and Topaz in the whole process. When they arrive at the Old Weapon Testing Ground, Svarog reveals that the Architects of Jarilo-VI have never activated the automatons made by the IPC 700 years ago, and that the overwhelming majority of the combatants against the Antimatter Legion were human. After Topaz decides to let the planet be, she gives Clara the Source Code, which Svarog believes was the right decision.[8]\nAfter the people of Jarilo-VI received an invitation from the Xianzhou Alliance to attend the Luminary Wardance, Luka was sent to serve as their representative while both Hook and Lynx tagged alongside him; the former due to a promise he had made her, and the latter to obtain information about a jade abacus that had been found on Igor's grave. Svarog was also sent to help watch over Hook, and he later attended the Wardance under the alias \"Mysterious Iron Arm\" in order to help improve Belobog's reputation. During their match, Svarog sensed that Luka was not putting in his all and told him to do so, leading to his defeat. Luka then asked him if he had a chance against Yanqing, though he did not give him a calculation, stating that he had to enter the ring and experience the battle himself. Svarog observed Luka's match against Yanqing before he and the rest of the Belobogians returned to Jarilo-VI.[9]\n"

In early 2156 AE, a representative of Technology Department of IPC, Dudley, offered to help expand Chadwick's influence and curiosity in imaginary physics by creating a weapon that would help bring peace to the universe. Chadwick was enticed and recruited other researchers who admired him. During the development of the Imaginary Implosion Pulse, Chadwick notably increased control parameters which made the weapon dangerous even for development purposes. After a chance encounter with Screwllum, Chadwick slowly realized he began to be duped, which became true when Dudley wanted the weapon fired to eliminate vanguards of the Antimatter Legion, who were about to attack IPC trade routes, deeming the collateral damage of 24 planets (of which 3 had grade 0 or higher civilizations) acceptable. After the weapon was activated, he was horrified at what he had done and learned from his colleagues that the IPC removed the higher-ups who had ordered the weapon's activation and condemned the tragedy.\nChadwick knew that the condemnation was lip service to the public, knowing that his knowledge on imaginary physics was too much for the IPC to slide by. Contacting Screwllum yet again, Chadwick managed to acquire some Selective Blocking Agent pills and consumed them. Indeed, the IPC came for him for his knowledge, but his constant refusals angered them to the point that offers of rewards went to house arrest with a forced emphasis on reading imaginary physics. The pills successfully prevented Chadwick from retaining knowledge, so the IPC eventually gave up trying to convince him in life. His physical body soon expired at some point.\nImmediately after his death, the IPC extracted and stored his memory in a Memory Bubble using technology made by Garden of Recollection. Since it was done as soon as possible, his consciousness was preserved as well. According to Screwllum's speculation, the Technology Department struck a deal with The Family in order to send him to Penacony and monitor his memoria. He was supervised by The Family inside the Dreamscape. The Trailblazer noticed him, and after learning that he was a former Genius Society member, they contacted Herta about it. Later, Screwllum went to Penacony to visit him. After learning about his past, Screwllum convinced The Family to bring the bubble to the space station. There, in Seclusion Zone, Chadwick's memory and consciousness faded as he entrusted his knowledge and technology to Herta.\n"

        "content": "As the Master Diviner of the Yuque, Jingtian was the only person who had the permission to manipulate the Cloudpeer Telescope, the ultimate astronomical observation device in the Xianzhou Alliance.[1] He was the master of Fu Xuan, who later ran away from the Yuque because she could not accept his prediction that his life will end in hers hands.[2]\nJingtian wore a somewhat aged pilot's outfit. His hand had, for some reason, been changed to a wood-made ingenium.[3]\nThe young Fu Xuan saw the operations and rites conducted by Yuque diviners, divining the brilliant future for her where she would claim the throne of the Yuque's master diviner. The divination results was submitted to Jingtian, and he agreed to personally supervising her tutelage.[4]\nOn the day when Fu Xuan became a Yuque diviner[4] and sought Jingtian for the first time, she found herself unable to believe that the man before her was the master diviner her elders had regarded so reverently. They discussed the ongoing warfare in which the Yuque's Echojade Fleet were currently laying out a defense at Thalassa in coordination with the Yaoqing's encirclement and eradication of abominations. He predicted that the Alliance was fated to lose this battle as his divination was gleaned from the newly arranged 'Deca-Light Reflection Barrier' matrix. She questioned his interpretation of this divination, and he recognized her as an apprentice that doesn't just accept things.[3]\nTo prove his view that everything is predetermined, Jingtian told Fu Xuan his story on the front lines. He had ventured deep into Thalassa the past few weeks, fought the abominations, and gained the trust of the local water dwellers. He received a shocking piece of news: Within a month's time, a great tide known to the Thalassans as the 'Devil's Tide' — caused by the gravitational influence of their moon — would arrive. None would be able to keep fighting the abominations in such abyssal conditions without the help from the Fanghu Vidyadhara's cloudhymn magi. This piece of intel did not exist on any guide, nor was it recorded in the Alliance's data bank. Only that, in order to validate his results in a moment of superfluous effort, he gave his hand as the price.[3]\nFu Xuan spent the happiest time in her life studying in the Yuque's Divination Commission. She learned about predestination versus free-will, about matrix calculations versus human choices. She recalled she was always arguing with Jingtian on every issue regarding divination and fortune-telling. Those were not aggressive confrontations with sharp words, but heated discussions between peers. And yet, though the two agreed on many topics, there was one issue they could not come to a consensus — Nous had granted divine volumes outlining the matrix calculations to the Xianzhou centuries ago. The Xianzhou Yuque's Divination Commission had pored over them to interpret and manifest the wisdom within, ultimately constructing the best divination matrix in the entire Alliance. Thought this is a point of pride for Yuque's diviners, Fu Xuan felt it was nothing short of culling the future possibilities of the Xianzhou people within the narrow path set out by the matrix.[2]\nDuring a debate, Jingtian admitted that he chose to take Fu Xuan in as his student after knowing about his predetermined future. After he consulted the Deca-Light Reflection Barrier and interpreted the hexagram, he firmly believed that his life will end in her hands. However, he was waiting for her to take over his position and become the Xianzhou Yuque's master diviner, because it had all been predetermined.[2]\nFu Xuan admired everything about Jingtian as a diviner. However, she could not accept how he willingly sank into the blinding abyss of fatalism and regarded it as an acceptable way of life, despite being a diviner who could peek into destiny. Therefore, Fu Xuan ran away from the Xianzhou Yuque despite her family's dissuasion and the hurdles she had to cross. She ran away like a self-exiled escapee, plunging into the Luofu's Divination Commission with its more unrestricted culture and devoted herself to calculations. Not only did she want to part from the Xianzhou Yuque, she also wanted to prove with her own hands that her teacher's prediction was nothing but his own ludicrous delusions.[2]\nCenturies passed thus, and the flames of war descended again in Year 8072 Star Calendar.[5] Diviner Fu Xuan calculated ceaselessly at her job. The grand armies of the Denizens of Abundance formed for the third time and launched a surprise attack on the Xianzhou Fanghu. The Yuque and the Luofu were close to the Fanghu, and it was their duty to give assistance. The divination revealed that all Xianzhou armies will meet a devastating defeat if they choose to face the assault head-on — however, should they keep up a defense, then there will be a chance to change the tides of battle. The hexagram did not reveal how this chance will come about. She calculated and divined over and over again, yet the results given by the Matrix of Prescience never changed.[1]\nFu Xuan outlined the pros and cons in writing and submitted the divination results to the Seat of Divine Foresight. However, as she expected, the outcome of the meeting between the Arbiter-Generals concluded that they must not take on a defensive position, not when such overwhelming numbers of the Abundance Axis were assaulting the Fanghu. The Cloud Knights of the Luofu and the Yuque must rise to face the enemy, buying time before the Yaoqing's army can arrive.[1]\nOn that day, Fu Xuan bore witness through the Projection Sandpit to the Alliance's army being decimated. Not only did the borisin bring fleets and mechabeasts numerous enough to block out the sky, they even summoned the incarnosphere Ketu Mirage from ancient legends. This evil gravitated toward the Fanghu, hellbent on bringing annihilation to all lives onboard, recreating the tragedy of the fall of the Xianzhou Cangcheng. And the only thing people could do was watch as it neared.[1]\nA bold idea surfaced in Fu Xuan's mind. She spoke her thoughts face-to-face with General Jing Yuan. It was no longer possible to obtain victory with the forces available to the Cloud Knights. The only chance of victory lies in making the Reignbow manifest themselves. She planned to ship the Yuque's Cloudpeer Telescope to the Fanghu using a Navis Astriger, and send out an SOS signal to the last observed location of the Reignbow's Lux Arrow. As the person who voiced this plan, she was willing to be on the front lines and execute it. Jing Yuan approved her plan and would take all responsibility as the one who made the suggestion to the Alliance. However, Jing Yuan pointed out that she did not have the permission to manipulate that device. She then realized that Jingtian was the only person who had the permission to use the Cloudpeer Telescope.[1]\nIn the end, Jingtian successfully executed the plan suggested by Fu Xuan, and presumably died on the front lines as the Lux Arrow fell. She eventually admitted that he was right all this time and there is only ever one path in destiny.[1]\n"

Caiyi was an ace gunner who many wanted to be flight partners with. When it came to pilots, Yukong was the best match for her, and they flew together all the time. Even Guangyuan, Caiyi's husband and pilot, couldn't match their numbers.[2]\nIn the Year 7900 Star Calendar, during its 33rd macro-sweep of the year, the Cloudpeer Telescope managed to detect Reignbow's manifestation. Trace elements pointed to three coordinates in the Consternation Starzone: The Yadav variable star; the Cerulean Nightmare; and the Knucklebone. Using the Matrix of Prescience Ultima, the master diviner predicted that it must have been plagued. The results were reported to the Xianzhou Yuque, and the prediction indeed came true. Upon investigation, the borisin Bluefang Pack had plundered everything, even trying to turn one of the worlds into a nursery for their weapons. But the Cloud Knights' Rainbowfall Fleet meted out punishment, enacting a famous victory.[3]\nIn the year 8072 Star Calendar, during the Third Abundance War, the Xianzhou Yaoqing and Xianzhou Fanghu alerted the The Xianzhou Luofu about the assembly of the Denizens of Abundance, the revival of Ketu Mirage; the roaming star and their attack on the Fanghu.

        "content": "After 30 years of dispute and controversy, my best friend Yewliho's posthumous autobiography: My Return to the Path, has finally been published. I could not be happier for her.\nI imagine that to the majority of my readers, both the name Yewliho and My Return to the Path are likely new to you. So, please allow me to tell you a little about her life in this preamble.\nIn the year 7992, Yewliho was born into a Bloodwind Pack beast ship operator family. The Bloodwind Pack \"inspired awe across the universe\" with their gigantic fleet of beast ships. Within a society like borisin that honors strength above all, beast ship operators from this generation, like Yewliho, naturally held a relatively high level of political influence.\nBy 8023, Yewliho already had her own personal fleet, the \"Preta,\" at only age 31. She had already independently planned and completed dozens of plunder and ransack missions.\nAs far as Xianzhou pilots at the time were concerned, Yewliho was an unparalleled nightmare. She was renowned for her fearless attacks and many schemes, and could be said to lead the most brutal and efficient fleet at that time.\nBefore long, thanks to her many military exploits, Yewliho's rank among the pack skyrocketed. In 8025, Yewliho and the Bloodwind Pack Chief Hosing Khan were married.\nAs it is borisin tradition for the chief's partner to act as the leader of all officials, Yewliho had suddenly risen to the second-highest rank within the Bloodwind Pack.\nIn 8032, Yewliho gave birth to a child named \"Cherluwoo.\" If everything went as planned, Cherluwoo would become the next leader of the pack.\nHowever, there was an unexpected development the year that Cherluwoo turned 5.\nOriginally, Hosing Khan had already exceeded 400 years of age without bearing an heir. If the regular route of succession were to be followed, the title of chief would go to the next \"Duran descendant\"... Hosing Khan's nephew, Kobo.\nHowever, the birth of Cherluwoo had shattered this plan. After having prepared all his life to inherit the pack, Kobo led the 3,000-strong beast ship fleet that had sworn loyalty to him to reclaim his power and attacked the chief's great beast ship.\nHosing Khan had no time to react before he was murdered by his bodyguards that Kobo had bribed. Naturally, Kobo's next targets would be Yewliho and her son. \nFortunately, Yewliho had always retained her own fleet that vowed loyalty to her, the Preta. Although they only boasted 300 ships, every member was a trusted ally that had accompanied her on pillages for many years.\nYewliho and her fleet successfully forced their way out of Kobo's encirclement. However, with the huge beast ship fleet that pursued them like locusts, there was no way for her mere 300 ships to escape.\nHowever, \"Kobo Khan\" called off his manhunt a short while later and returned to the Bloodwind Pack, successfully becoming the next chief. Yewliho would never say how she managed to escape that lethal pursuit. All that we know is that her only child, Cherluwoo, died during that escape.\nIn the year 8038, Yewliho led the Preta (with 127 men remaining) to the Fanghu, determined to submit and pledge allegiance to the Alliance.\nAfter two long years of careful deliberation, the Alliance decided to pardon these borisin for their crimes and allow them to live inside the Fanghu under strict surveillance... This was on the condition that they comply with all Alliance research on borisin, as well as submitting all beast ship-related technology to them.\nThis was also the time that I met Yewliho. As a cultural anthropologist, I was ordered to interview these 127 borisin, in order to deepen our understanding of borisin society.\nThroughout the course of my research, Yewliho and I developed a deep friendship. She was an intelligent, frank, and courageous warrior who was able to summarize the complex and chaotic world of borisin society and logic to me in concise, clear language.\nLikely because of her hatred towards Kobo, Yewliho always hoped that she would be able to lead her Preta to fight for the Alliance. However, a request like this was unlikely to receive approval.\nYewliho made this request again and again and was rejected every time... After 30 years, she could bear this cycle no longer and began to seek my assistance.\nI suggested that she write a long letter explaining her life and background in detail. This would allow her to explain her hatred of her enemies to the Seven Arbiter-Generals and why she longs to fight for the Alliance. When she did this, I would be willing to put my personal reputation on the line to vouch for her.\nTwo years later, she wrote My Return to the Path.\nPerhaps this was truly some cruel trick of fate... But, in 8072, not long after she had written this letter, the third Denizens of Abundance War broke out.\nWith the Fanghu serving as the main battleground, it quickly descended into a terrifying bloodbath. Pressed with their backs up against the wall, no one was free to keep watch over Yewliho... So, without receiving permission from the Alliance, the Preta launched their final assault.\nWe never learned just how many Abominations of Abundance the Preta wiped out in the war. However, what we can be sure of is that they managed to transport at least 4,000 civilians to safety before the Reignbow's Lux Arrow descended.\nAnd during this process, all 127 borisin warriors, including Yewliho perished.\nDue to the sensitive nature of Yewliho's identity and her undeniable past wrongdoings, her story has been concealed under the surface of history to this day. That is why My Return to the Path was never able to be published.\nI have been working hard for years to make sure that My Return to the Path gets published, in the hopes that her story could appear on my readers' desks, like it can today.\nHonestly, I almost don't care about the book's academic merit, I just care about my selfish motives: I want to introduce the story of my friend Yewliho to you all...\nShe was an Abomination of Abundance that was full of evil, a covetous thief, and a criminal with blood-soaked hands.She was a Xianzhou person who never gained recognition, a courageous warrior, and a mother filled with rage and sorrow.\n"

When Yufei is enlisted in the war against the Denizens of Abundance, her faith in Lan wanes after witnessing a fellow Incomplete One being cured of his disabilities upon becoming mara-struck.\nYufei is killed in action, and after learning from the Cloud Knights that she was a casualty of the Reignbow Arbiter's Lux Arrow, Dan Shu rejected THEM and turned to Yaoshi, eventually becoming the leader of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, seeking converts to her cause via other members such as Mauve Moon. She puts up the front of a chief alchemist, treating people with normal medicine. Following the banishment of the previous head, Cauldron Master Yunhua, Dan Shu served as the Luofu Alchemy Commission's acting head.\nAs the Master of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, Dan Shu made contact with the Lord Ravager Phantylia. She agreed to help smuggle a Stellaron onto the Luofu, while Luocha would help with the process. Phantilya promised to give them new, undying bodies with the revived Ambrosial Arbor, which Dan Shu found agreeable due to the sect's desire for immortal bodies.\nDan Shu encounters the Trailblazer when they approach her to help study the Draught of Draconic Surge. After writing her notes on the potion, she asks them to help bring a potion to a blind girl, who was being bullied by other children. The Trailblazer drives them off, though she asks them to help watch the girl after she wanders into the Artisanship Commission and puts herself in danger. Saving the girl a second time, Dan Shu offers the Trailblazer a Brumdew Concentrade Pellet that would improve their health and increase their lifespan. They have the option of taking it or not.\nIf the Trailblazer took the pellet, they head to the Seat of Divine Foresight and nearly end up killing the guards there, having believed them to be mara-struck. If they did not, they show the pellet to Qingzu, who has it analyzed and discovers it is the same as the pellets manufactured by the Disciples. Regardless, the Trailblazer searches for her to get answers, finding her at the Artisanship Commission. A disciple notices them, but Dan Shu orders them to stand down, as she had considered them a friend despite their short interaction with each other. The Trailblazer then has the option to either attempt to take her into custody or let her go, as she knew they were an outsider that did not need to get involved. Regardless of their decision, Dan Shu eventually leaves the area.[3]\nAfter reviving the Ambrosial Arbor, Dan Shu leads her forces into attacking various areas of the Luofu, with particularly fierce fighting around the Alchemy Commission. To prevent the Alliance from reaching them, Dan Shu had the Aureate Elixir Furnace filled with mara-filled pellets and activated, which would turn any Alliance member into a mara-struck being if they attempted to approach them.

Recognizing Fu Xuan and pitying her decision to forgo \"greater\" power, Dan Shu and her members battle the group, only to be defeated.

        "content": "Yufei was a kind, hardworking woman and one of the Luofu's best healers. She had short black hair, ebony eyes, and pale skin. Her voice was pleasant to listen to, described by Dan Shu as sounding like \"the touch of cold streams brushing past [her] fingertips.\"[1]\nYufei and Dan Shu met when they were both seven years old. Yufei drove away the bullies tormenting Dan Shu and they became best friends. During school holidays, Yufei would take Dan Shu to visit glamorous scenes in various ecological delves and describe their beauty to her blind friend.[1]\nYufei helped Dan Shu come up with many strategies to restore the latter's sight, though none of them worked. One idea that Yufei specifically came up with was an extension of the non-invasive prosthetic eyes concept, to trigger sensory compensation using other senses (auditory, tactile, gustatory, and olfactory). The two of them created a prototype gadget, but all its external sensors added together were extremely heavy. The gadget's size and weight proved difficult to carry, let alone test. After many failed experiments, Dan Shu went behind Yufei's back and got an eye transplant. Though Dan Shu could now see, Yufei kept crying, likely out of sorrow for the pain that Dan Shu would eventually experience as her body rejected the transplant.[1]\nDuring the Third Abundance War, Yufei was conscripted and stationed at a field hospital on the Xianzhou Fanghu. Though both she and Dan Shu believed she would be safe away from the front lines, she died in the collateral damage wrought by Lan's Lux Arrow. Her death led to Dan Shu's loss of faith in the Reignbow Arbiter, and she would eventually join the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus.[1][2]\n"

        "content": "The Verdant Knights, official designation Verdantia Fleet, are an elite unit of Cloud Knights mainly comprised of Foxians under the direct command of the Arbiter-General of the Xianzhou Yaoqing. The Verdant Knights of the Yaoqing are said to be as valiant as the Borisin Wolftroopers.[1]\nThe Foxian warriors of the Verdant Knights are rumored to often rescue worlds ruled by the borisin. These foxians born in \"fallen territories\" have mixed bloodlines and occasionally produce individuals exhibiting atavistic mutations. The borisin use them as vanguards in battle and as cannon fodder to delay attacks by the Xianzhou Alliance.\nThese war slaves possess strength and speed on par with the borisin but their mutations deplete their life and sanity until they become bloodthirsty monsters. When they lose their will to bestial fury, their gauntlets become shackles that bind their hands. The Verdant Knights recruit from these foxians and give them a chance to fight back against the borisin. \nEven if their swords broke and their bows snapped, without any weapons left in their hands, they could still fight to the death relying solely on the sharp claws on their bionic gauntlets integrated with the body.[1] They are known for riding Yaoqing starskiffs into battle as loyal partners who are capable of aiding them in eradicating abominations.[2] Their fighting style is described as bold and sweeping.[3]\nThe Verdant Knights wear porcelain armor said to be light as wind and strong as steel while in flight fighting against their foes, allowing them to withstand the borisin's claws and biotech weapons. The eagle helmet of the Verdant Knights, modeled after the ferocious bird \"Dafeng\", had two pairs of auxiliary eyes, ensuring clear vision of their surroundings under any lighting conditions. They also had combat boots fashioned after talons that allow the wearer to swiftly dash onto the battlefield like the wind, effortlessly traversing through thorns and rugged terrain.[4][5][6]\nThe symbol of the Verdant Knights is Flying Aureus, the Spiritus bestowed upon the Arbiter-General of the Yaoqing by the Reignbow Arbiter.[7]\nIn the year 8072 Star Calendar, during the Third Abundance War, the Xianzhou Yaoqing and Xianzhou Fanghu alerted the The Xianzhou Luofu about the assembly of the Denizens of Abundance, the revival of Ketu Mirage; the roaming star and their attack on the Fanghu. The Luofu dispatched four brigades of Cloud Knights to help them fight but they were still facing defeat. Diviner Fu Xuan came up with a plan to use the Xianzhou Yuque's Cloudpeer Telescope to call Reignbow Arbiter.[8]\nThe Reignbow Arbiter then descended onto the battlefield and annihilated the borisins' fleet using their Lux Arrow, During the course of this battle, the Xianzhou Luofu lost over 63,000 fighter jets and over 120,000 pilots, and nearly one-fifth of the Xianzhou Fanghu's delves are destroyed by the Lux Arrow's bombardment. The extent of the damage to the Yaoqing's forces is unknown, however, General Yueyu of the Yaoqing leading a unit of Verdant Knights were among those perished in Lan's bombardment as she was in the vicinity of the Cloudpeer Telescope. Sometime after, Feixiao took up office.[9][10]\nIn recent history, the Verdant Knights were dispatched by General Feixiao to follow a route mentioned by Luofu Sky-Faring Commission Helm-Master Yukong and discovered the wreckage of Amicassador Tingyun's Whistling Flames ship. Unfortunately, there were no survivors, and no cargo, but they had discovered Genius Society #81 Ruan Mei had arrived on scene beforehand.[11] The scouts of the Verdant Knights also sent back reports that borisin were making trouble again. The borisin packs that were once divided and scattered had started swallowing each other up, forming larger and larger packs. Moreover, they had found that an entity named \"Mangas\" was behind it all.[12]\n"

She became jaded after years of fighting and would always act strong no matter what terrible things befell her. At some point, Caiyi met her fellow pilot Guangyuan, and the two fell in love and got married. They often manned the same starskiff and their combined prowess was the envy of many. During the Third Abundance War, Caiyi and Guangyuan conceived a child, but Guangyuan was killed in battle before the birth of their child. After Guangyuan's death, Caiyi would rarely team up with anyone except for Yukong.[2]\nAt some point, Caiyi went on maternity leave and gave birth to Qingni, whom she named per Yukong's suggestion. She returned to the front lines after a few months. In the last crucial battle, the Xianzhou forces engaged the main borisin fleet and Caiyi was fatally injured. Her last words to Yukong were to not let Qingni become a fighter pilot.[2]\nFollowing Caiyi's death, Yukong adopted Qingni and raised her as her own daughter. Yukong was deeply affected by the events of the war and resigned from being a pilot. She took up office work in the Sky-Faring Commission and eventually its Helm Master. As per Caiyi's last wishes, Yukong did her best to dissuade Qingni from becoming a fighter pilot, though she eventually let go of her past fears and ceded to her daughter's wishes.[2]\nDuring the events of A Foxian Tale of the Haunted, a heliobus took on the form of Caiyi and had a short talk with Yukong, before being exorcized.[3]\n"

        "content": "There are two different groups of Disciples of Sanctus Medicus who share the same name. The first group, known as the Old Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, was a generally harmless group that worshiped Yaoshi in secrecy for thousands of years until they transformed into the Cold Springs sect. The Cold Springs sect led the Xianzhou in reforming their healthcare system and eventually declared their renouncement of Yaoshi. They believed that mara existed because Yaoshi's will was improperly executed.\nThe more recent Disciples of Sanctus Medicus rose in the wake of the Third Abundance War less than 30 years ago. They operated in secrecy, seeking to lead the Xianzhou Alliance on the Path of Abundance. They believe that mara, rather than being a curse, is a kind of \"blessed evolution.\"[1] The leader, Dan Shu, obtained a Stellaron from Phantylia and revived the Ambrosial Arbor in a rebellion against the Xianzhou. They were defeated by the Cloud Knights of the Luofu with the assistance of the Astral Express Crew, though many still continue to operate in secrecy.\nThey number in the \"tens of thousands\" and have a \"flat\" organizational structure, with the head of each area reporting directly to the master. This is applied so that if their enemies were to wipe out one area of the group, it wouldn't affect the other areas.[1]\nNew members are put through several trials to prove their loyalty. The first is transcribing the Thousand-Handed Merciful Medicus' Salvation scripture 500 times by hand. Another is a fight to the death with another prospective member, though this is possibly made up on the spot by Green Hibiscus due to his suspicion of the Strange Cloud Knight being a spy from the Seat of Divine Foresight. Once accepted into the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, new members are given a new identity.\nThe Disciples of Sanctus Medicus continued to worship Yaoshi as other Aeons like Qlipoth the Preservation, known as the Firmamend Arbiter among the Xianzhou, and Lan the Hunt, became ascendant in the Xianzhou Alliance. Although sharing the same name, the Disciples consist of two distinct groups. The first group, known as the Old Disciples of Sanctus Medicus to differentiate them from the more recent group, believed that the Denizens of Abundance deviated from Yaoshi's will and the mara-struck only existed because Yaoshi's will was improperly executed.[2]\nAfter the Theophany era, countless secret believers of Yaoshi wrote books and established schools to preach the correctness of their beliefs. Others established a medical system rooted in the worship of Yaoshi. The most influential of the books is Yaoshi's Manual of Viscerals. It was the first to systematically establish \"Yaoshi medical sciences\" that connected the science to the worship of Yaoshi. This was the beginning of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. The Manual originally had 75 volumes but the currently available version is a four-volume version re-edited from the remnants of the book by archivists. These residual chapters were mainly taken from sources of the time that rebuked the religion of Sanctus Medicus, and some of them could be inaccurate or completely false.[2]\nThe Old Disciples' first master primus was Yueyan, the Foxian Helm Master of the Xianzhou Yaoqing's Sky-Faring Commission. Yueyan witnessed the destruction of Muldrasil by the Antimatter Legion. Due to Xianzhou's creed of eradicating abominations, the Alliance stood by and observed the entire process. The overwhelming death and destruction shook Yueyan's belief in the long-life species' duty and purpose in life. Yueyan left his position and roamed the stellar seas with a starkiff in search of an answer. He found Shuhu, an Emanator of Yaoshi, on the ancient planet of Rahu and witnessed Shuhu's resurrection of the planet, which had died long ago. The planet throbbed like an embryo in the mother's womb. He followed Shuhu and recorded their healing miracles and various teachings, ultimately composing the Divine Scripture of the Secrets and Miracles of Shuhu's Manifestations.[3]\nA branch of the Old Disciples known as the Inner Secrets Sect authored the Scripture of Yellow Pneuma Yang Essence. The Inner Secrets Sect believed that the Xianzhou natives' bodies possess circulatory vessels similar to the branching form of the Ambrosial Arbor after receiving the blessing of the Arbor and becoming long-life species. These circuits lead toward an organ known as the Core Esse, which is key to the Xianzhou natives' second evolution (alternatively known as the ascension). The Scripture proposed that the body should be considered as soil, the breath considered rain, and combined they nurture the Core Esse (a seed) to spread the circulatory system (as branches), finally achieving an \"inner Ambrosial Arbor\" that thrives and grows as an \"inner secret.\" The Yellow Pneuma mentioned in the book's title is an essence that drives the vitals in the theories of the Inner Secrets Sect, and opposes the Black Prana that symbolizes death and decay. The author believes that the purpose of life is to maintain the presence of Yellow Pneuma and let life continue to evolve. The views of the Inner Secrets Sect are considered superstition.[3]\nThe Old Disciples were not a notorious group for a long time and accepted skepticism with an open mind. They built apothecaries to help the poor and needy. They were treated with pity by those who had long abandoned their belief in Yaoshi but were not particularly detested. They existed in secret for thousands of years and eventually became the Cold Springs sect, which overhauled the entire Xianzhou healthcare system.[2]\nAccording to Overview of Xianzhou's Materia Medica, the Cold Springs sect was formed by young members of the Alchemy Commission and originally named the Cold Springs delve. They re-discovered Liu Hua's Medical Compendium, written by a Vidyadhara who wanted to better explain the principles of Xianzhou medical science using more scientific methods of inquiry, and used it as the standard for medicine. Later, the Cold Springs Sect's innovative thoughts were gradually acknowledged by the various groups in the Alliance, and Liu Hua's Medical Compendium received the credit it deserved.[3]\nAfter the Three Sufferings era, the Xianzhou completely banned belief in Yaoshi. Dan Shu's predecessor, Yunhua, was banished amdist a dispute regarding the Vidyadhara. Their whereabouts are currently unknown.[4][5]\nThe more recent group of Disciples, considered criminals in the Xianzhou, is less than 30 years old and arose in the wake of the Third Abundance War. Some blamed the Alliance and the Hunt for the suffering they endured. They used the same name as the old group, gathered around a \"master primus\", and claimed to have inherited the knowledge and legacy of the Theophany Era. They sought to lead the Xianzhou into the embrace of Yaoshi. In response, the Cold Springs sect published a statement clarifying that they no longer believed in Yaoshi.[2][6]\nThe Master of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, Dan Shu, was motivated by her desire for revenge against Lan The Hunt, who she formerly worshiped. Her friend Yufei died during the Third Abundance War when Lan's Lux Arrow destroyed the enemies as well as the field hospital she was based in. Dan Shu made a deal with Phantylia, a Lord Ravager and Emanator of Nanook the Destruction, to deliver a Stellaron to her. Phantylia arranged for the Stellaron to be brought aboard the Xianzhou by Luocha[7]. Dan Shu used the Stellaron to revive the Ambrosial Arbor and rebel against the Xianzhou, using both the sect and recently acquired Abundance Sprites to cause chaos in various areas of the Luofu.[8] Eventually, her rebellion was stopped by the Xianzhou and Astral Express, though remnants of her sect continue to operate in the shadows.[9][10]\nAccording to the Official Announcement on the Origins of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, the beliefs and texts of these Disciples are almost unrelated to the original Disciples. The Thousand-Handed Merciful Medicus' Salvation that their followers recite daily is a forgery and not a classic text written by the original Disciples, who valued texts such as the Scripture of Yellow Pneuma Yang Essence that provide guidance for spiritual practice.[6]\nWhile the Old Disciples believed that mara was the result of improperly executing Yaoshi's will,[2] Dan Shu's Disciples believed that mara was a kind of blessed evolution. To them, belief in Yaoshi, known as Sanctus Medicus, is the one ultimate faith. To become a disciple, one had to pass trials. The first trial was to copy the Thousand-Handed Merciful Medicus' Salvation 50,000 times. It was later changed to 500 times.[1] The text is considered to be a forgery by the Xianzhou government and unrelated to the Old Disciples.[6] The second trial involved two candidates fighting to the death with the survivor officially becoming a disciple.[1]\nDan Shu's Disciples developed a drug that can induce mara in long-lived species while retaining their sanity. Known as the Draught of Draconic Surge, it is made from various ingredients, but the core ingredient is Vidyadhara bone marrow tissue obtained from a living specimen. When the Trailblazer infiltrated the organization, Mauve Moon told them that they should have no trouble obtaining the rarer ingredients considering their strength, implying that the Vidyadhara bone marrow was obtained using force. An internal prescription circulated among the Disciples says that if one managed to survive the drug, which may cause severe pain all over the body, abnormal bone noises, plus partial loss of sight and hearing, they will attain the way of immortality. However a report prepared by Dan Shu for the Seat of Divine Foresight says that for short-life species, it enhances their bodily capacities for a short period, after which their body suffers a catastrophic regression once all the Vidyadhara cells in the host's body have perished. The only thing preventing such an outcome perhaps being other drugs developed by the Disciples. Dan Shu fed this drug to Xiao Ju, a Xianzhou native, which cured him of of the long term infirmity he has had since he was a child. However the patient reported sharp pain all over his body and mental confusion every time he took the pill.[11][1]\nThey also developed a drug known as the Semblance Reversion Essence that allows the mara-struck who have transformed to revert to their original appearance. However the drug's potency reduces with repeated use and will eventually cease to have any effect. The Disciples do not consider this a permanent solution nor the mara transformation to be undesirable. They believe mara is the first step to ascension given to them by Yaoshi.[11]\nDespite the Disciples' supposed ability to control mara, their members who were captured by the Cloud Knights during battle exhibited signs of delusion and hallucination. One disciple saw themselves becoming the storm, the Abundant Ebon Deer, and a scene of leaves and branches covering the sky. Another disciple claimed that to be mara-struck was to eliminate the self, to achieve transcendance, a true life of freedom, and a second life gifted by Sanctus Medicus. The Disciples are also able to elicit uncontrollable mara through smoke infused with medicinal pellets.[9]\nSome Vidyadhara Preceptors are suspected to have colluded with the Disciples and Dan Shu was in contact with them.[5]\nThe Disciples conducted various experiments using Vidyadhara blood and bone marrow. One experiment conducted during the tenure of Dan Shu's predecessor included injecting Vidyadhara blood and marrow fluid into various species to observe the reactions in their normal and mara-struck states.[4]\n"

With the Gray Knight's assistance, she escaped to Kincharitges State — the Empress Dowager's fiefdom. Later, the Empress Dowager rallied her army and overthrew the second sister's short-lived imperial rule. Tizocic II ascended the throne and became the Pupsha Empire's Emperor. In order to protect her daughter, the Empress Dowager began ruling in her stead.\nWhen Tizocic II was of age, the Empress Dowager passed away, and her extended family did not intend to return her imperial authority. During a trial, Tizocic II accused her uncle, General Daquette, for the death of Tax Collector Turian's 49 family members. He made an attempt on her life but was killed. She then summoned the real culprit, Lenamar, to whom she promised the role of the Empire's Spymaster, and executed her with poisoned wine. In the next few months, she used the tax collector extermination as an excuse to eradicate the Empress Dowager's clansmen and felt as if she had to kill more and more people that opposed her rule.\nLater, Tizocic II chose to kill a captured rebel and his family, fearing a future coup attempt, and her chef, after suspecting him of trying to poison her. She ordered a minister to carry out a saturation bombing on Pasdrak City, where four million citizens lived, after three rebellions occurred in the city within five years. When he refused, he was thrown in along with the bombs. She killed another minister after he provided relief aid to disaster victims in his hometown, with her reasoning that it was not fair for the rest of the refugees throughout the Empire and that her actions would be compared to his. At the end of her rule, her retainers killed the Gray Knight for freeing traitors. When revolutionaries barged into the palace, she had already fled to Penacony. She asked The Family to seal her past memories, for they brought her nothing but fear.\nIn Penacony, she takes on the appearance of a Halovian and proclaims herself as an \"emperor.\" She becomes known as a benevolent person and often helps others throughout Penacony.\nBack to her real self thanks to the Trailblazer, Tizocic II willingly abides with Swanga, Executive Leader of the Old Empire Dissolution Committee of the Pupsha Republic, and his Vice-Leader, Illifan, to be arrested and taken back to Pupsha, where she will stand trial. She is charged for numerous offenses, including 70 war crimes and 13.12 million murders.\nHer \"emperor\" role is succeeded by an Intellitron known as Tizocic III, who voluntarily continues her predecessor's benevolent career. Tizocic III uses \"the late\" to refer to Tizocic II, which implies the latter was executed for her crimes.\n"

From then on, Izumo started its long and arduous crusade, exchanging inordinate lives lost for the fall of one Kami after another. They slew one particularly powerful Kami, the \"Sovereign of Revelation,\" and used its body to forge the first Edict Edge (also known as a Sentinel).[2] The wielders of these swords could recite the mantra contained within to master the divine power of Takamagahara, and use it to combat the Kami.[1] During the long war against the Kami, the people broke 70,033 warrior's blades and forged twelve Sentinels.[5]\nThe people of Izumo also used the might of the Edict Edges to light up their uncivilized world of darkness.

Rather than calling it the Marketing Development Department, the simulated character refers to it as the \"Fanaticism Department\" instead.[4] Oswaldo's personality convinced the IPC to recruit him, as he's willing to change his persona based on others around him.[5]\nAlthough inexperienced and one of the younger department heads, especially in contrast to other directors,[3] through his marketing strategy, many new worlds joined the IPC's business structure to obtain the right to operate the Cosmic Big Lotto.[6][7] His successful business strategy led the Business Consolidation Department to adopt his product vision, and many within the IPC to believe he will soon rise to the ranks of the Seven Board of Directors, if not for his lack of experience and absence of available positions.[2]\nWhen Oswaldo first took charge of the Marketing Development Department, one of the three major issues he addressed was the operation on Sigonia-IV, which had troubled the department for multiple Amber Eras.[8]\nUnder the department's guidance, the Sigonians successfully signed and established the Sigonian Sovereignty in accordance with the Interstellar Peace Charter, securing a legislative seat at the Interstellar Congress.[9] However, due to prejudice among Sigonian parlimentarians, the Avgins and Katicans were excluded from the sovereignty and subsequently banished to the desert.

Facing both time constraints and resistance from the locals, he incentivized his crew with the promise of reward for the first person to acquire the resource, while also permitting the use of military force against the population to \"bring civilization to this world.\"[11]\nAccording to the planetary records of Aeragan-Epharshel, the locals who roamed and farmed the land for generations were wiped out by an unknown disaster. The survivors, mostly frail elderly and youth, now only shelter in smaller and smaller reservations. To this day, that black ore is still used in massive quantities as a rare metal to create devastating weaponry, and is shipped out to more and more planets on fleets of IPC transport ships.[11]\nThe Galaxy Ranger Boothill, a survivor of Aeragan-Epharshel, is currently looking for Oswaldo for vengeance. Despite efforts to locate him through official announcements and middle managers, Oswaldo's whereabouts remain untraceable. Resorting to tracking down IPC members who share his disdain for him, Boothill followed the IPC spaceship sailing toward Penacony.[12]\nSometime after Sunday was defeated in the Charmony Festival on Penacony, Boothill broke into Aventurine's guest room in the hotel and confronted him.[13] Aventurine agreed to help him due to the feud between the Marketing Development Department and Strategic Investment Department.[14]\nAt some point after the IPC allied with the Xianzhou Alliance, the latter later conducted an investigation to determine if they would pose a threat to them in the future. Of the department heads and other higher-ups, Oswaldo was notably the only one that was considered a high threat to the alliance, being noted for his inexperience, zealotry and an expansionist.[3]\n"

        "content": "Sigonia-IV has an extremely harsh surface environment with low precipitation, and is constantly at risk of being hit by small-scale celestial objects.[1]\nFew sapient species live on Sigonia-IV due to its extreme conditions. The planet's human inhabitants are divided into several nomadic tribes, and have developed their own folk beliefs independent of the Aeon belief system.[1]\nDue to the harsh conditions on Sigonia, only a few intelligent races live there, collectively referred to as Sigonians by the Intelligentsia Guild. Though they share a common language, these races have fragmented into clans, with most adopting nomadic lifestyles while some have established central governments. Two of these clans include the Katicans and Avgins.[2]\n\"Katica\" means \"shellslasher\" in the Sigonian language. The Katicans have a reputation for being the most ferocious of the Sigonian clans.[2]\n\"Avgin\" means \"honey\" in the Sigonian language. The Avgins are blessed with attractive facial features, beautiful eyes, and an innate wealth of emotional intelligence. These traits inspire jealousy in others, so the Avgins face slander and baseless defamation from many others.[3] They are often accused of petty theft. This led the reputation of the Avgins to be viewed with suspicion.[2] The Avgins have an appreciation for intricately patterned fabrics, as well as a penchant for jewelry crafted from precious gemstones. They're particularly fond of turquoise meteorites.\nThe Avgins worship a Mother Goddess called Gaiathra Triclops, otherwise known as Fenge Biyos. Depictions of the Mother Goddess in the Avgins' religion often portray her as a left palm adorned with three eyes. The Avgins primarily express reverence for her through spoken prayers alone, believing that the Mother Goddess is as silent and unassuming as the mountains of Sigonia, and that crafting statues or composing hymns for her would only distance themselves from her protective embrace.[3]\nThe Avgins have a festival known as Kakava, which celebrates the yearly rebirth of Gaiathra Triclops. They believe that all that exists on the land is a part of Gaiathra's divine body, and that this body perishes each year and ascends as an aurora in the night sky. Then, Gaiathra is reborn the next day. During this festival, they weave sacrificial vessels known as \"Knots of Cyclicality\" and toss them into bonfires to commemorate the Great Goddess's birth.[3]\nThe Avgins and Katicans had a long-standing enmity, and were engaged in a cycle of enmity for many Amber Eras. \n(To be added.)[1]\nOne day, the IPC initiated an operation on Sigonia led by Oswaldo Schneider. Under the IPC's guidance, Sigonians established the Sigonian Sovereignty according to the Interstellar Peace Charter. However, due to the other clans' prejudice against the Avgins and the Katicans, these two clans were excluded from the sovereignty. Through a parliamentary decision, the other Sigonians banished the two clans to the desert, and even declared Avgins autonomous, thus absolving themselves of responsibility should any future conflicts occur between the two clans.[2]\nDuring one Kakava,[2] the Katicans launched a massive attack on the Avgins, who were under the protection of the IPC. The attack absolutely decimated the Avgin population, resulting in 6,728 deaths and 3,452 missing.[4] Aventurine was likely the sole Avgin survivor of this attack.[1]\n1 Character matches the category selection:\n"

Eventually, the clan suffered a massacre by the Katicans during the Kakava festival. It is suspected that Aventurine is the only living survivor of the Avgins.[1]\nIndividuals of the Avgins possess attractive facial features, unique beautiful eyes, and high emotional intelligence. Although these features enhance their charisma, they are also causes for jealousy and hatred from others.[2] As a result, the Avgins face prejudice and defamation to the point they've become infamous, with some describing them as liars, social manipulators, and two-faced thieves.[3][2]\n\nContrary to some other civilizations, the Avgins follow a religion removed from the Aeon belief system.[1] Their Mother Goddess is known as Fenge Biyos or Gaiathra Triclops. The Avgins believe SHE is the goddess of fertility, travel, and trickery. The Mother Goddess is often depicted as a left palm with three eyes. The Avgins worship their goddess through spoken prayers alone, as they believe that more pompous means of worship do not reflect HER humble nature and only serve to distance them from HER.[4]The Avgins see the world through the body of their Mother Goddess, believing that landmarks are merely parts of HER body. According to them, on the last day of each calendar year, the Mother Goddess' body must perish to be reborn the next day. Thus, they celebrate the first day of the new year through a festival known as the Kakava Festival.[2]\nThe Avgins also show fondness for well-made patterned fabrics and jewelry made of precious gemstones, especially turquoise meteorites, whose beauty rivals that of the Mother Goddess' divine body.[2]\nAdditionally, the Avgins understand the benefits of friendship and value trickery.[6]\nDue to Sigonia-IV's harsh environmental conditions, only a small number of intelligent civilizations are able to survive on the planet.[1][4] The inhabitants of Sigonia are known as Sigonians and share a common language. Despite this, Sigonians have fragmented into numerous clans, with many sharing a vendetta against one another. Until the IPC's intervention, they participated in numerous wars between each other.[4] Among these clans are the Katicans and the Avgins, the rivalry of which lasted Amber Eras and once even led to a bloody conflict known as The (First) Katica-Avgin Extinction Event.[1]\nWhen the IPC's Marketing Development Department arrived on Sigonia, its head, Oswaldo Schneider, led an operation that established a compromise known as \"Sigonian Sovereignty\", which united the Sigonian clans and allowed them to expand interspatially.[4] The IPC then granted the newly-formed political entity a legislative seat at the Interstellar Congress.[1]\nHowever, due to the other clans' prejudice against the Avgins and the Katicans, the two clans were excluded by other Sigonians from the compromise and, instead, through a parliamentary decision, were banished to the desert. Additionally, the Sigonians used the opportunity to promise Avgins autonomy, thus removing themselves from the responsibility should any conflicts occur between the two clans.[4]\nYears after the banishment, the Avgins and the Katicans continued their disagreements. Eventually, the Katicans began to plan a mass genocide due to their vendetta against the Avgins, who, upon realizing this, requested help from the Marketing Development Department, to which they agreed. The genocide was planned to take action on the day of the Kakava Festival. Despite their promise to aid Avgins against the war, on that day, the Marketing Development Department failed to participate. As a result, thousands of Avgins were killed or went missing, marking the end of the Avgin clan.[7] Aventurine is the last known Avgin to have survived the attack.[1]\n1 Character matches the category selection:\n"

Its members' origins are varied, and their responsibilities and personalities differ. While they could be seen similarly to the Astral Express or Stellaron Hunters, both Jade and Opal have stated that the group is only united by a need to obtain what they want, with a void that desires to be filled by said need. Diamond picked each member to join him on their journey and made a promise to share his power equally to them, which would help satisfy some of their needs and ultimately help Qlipoth when the war among the Aeons inevitably arrives.[1] The group has a somewhat notorious reputation among the corporation, though many agree that Topaz is considered the least controversial of them[2][3], likely due to her disdain of business etiquette and a genuine desire to help others.[4][5]\nWhile under Diamond's leadership, he allows the Ten Stonehearts to be independent on matters of the team's survival.[6]\nEach member is given a name corresponding to their Cornerstone,[Note 1] and they are generally called by this name rather than their actual name.[7] The Cornerstones are sacred stones that seal the authority of a Emanator of Preservation within them. The Ten Stonehearts can use their stone to obtain this share of authority and be granted great power.[8] It is said that the Ten Stonehearts must cut their Cornerstone with their own will in order to allow its brilliance to radiate. Even a shattered Cornerstone can still confer a great amount of power.[9]\nThe Ten Stonehearts generally value their Cornerstones more than their own lives and each Cornerstone gives different abilities to each Stoneheart, such as the ability to read minds. The Aventurine Stone transforms Aventurine, allows him to levitate, and summons giant poker chips from the sky.[10] The Jade Stone allowed Jade to see all desires that flowed through dreams when it was sent into Penacony.[11] Compared to Aventurine, the Topaz Stone's ability is not as \"visual\"[12], though Topaz tells the Trailblazer she would have used her Cornerstone in Belobog had Bronya not come in time.[13]\nAfter the IPC discovers that a civilization still existed on Jarilo-VI following the sealing of its Stellaron, Topaz was sent to collect the debt The Architects had loaned from them 700 years ago.[14] It is said that the debt was extremely high to the point that Bronya herself didn't know how to read it.[15] Bronya was given two choices by Topaz: To pay the debt in full, or to sign the civilians of Belobog to the IPC's workforce, which will null the debt and also help rebuild the planet's ecosystem.[5] Bronya was initially unsure of what to do, but after learning from Himeko that the IPC's planet restoration projects were not always successful, she eventually chose to reject the offer. This resulted in a brief skirmish with Topaz's subordinates, but Bronya reveals the Engine of Creation to her, revealing that the people of Jarilo-VI wanted to restore their planet with their own hands. She convinced Topaz to help waiver the acquisition of the planet while promising to repay the debts over time.[5]\nTopaz was convinced and managed to cancel the acquisition of Jarilo-VI, resulting in the mission being a failure; as punishment, several of her bonuses were revoked and she was dropped from P45 to P44. During this time, Diamond managed to secure the support of Taravan Keane, the head of the Building Material Logistics Department and an Emanator of Preservation.[5]\nIn an attempt to win over more support from the IPC's board, Diamond assigned Opal to use the Charmony Festival as a way to win back Penacony. Seeing Opal's tactics were too extreme, he instead elected Aventurine to lead the project.[16] Aventurine in turn enlisted the help of Jade and Topaz, and took each of their Cornerstones to use as a diversion to sneak his shattered Cornerstone onto Penacony.[17] During the Charmony Festival, Aventurine forced a fight with the Astral Express Crew and Acheron, an Emanator of Nihility; the latter struck him through the Order's protection on Penacony,[18] sending him to the primordial dreamscape. While in the primordial dreamscape, his Cornerstone would be damaged further and he had to be saved by Argenti, a Knight of Beauty.[19] Using the leverage gained by Aventurine's \"death\" and the Order's plot, Jade and Topaz would push negotiations with The Family.[11]\nAfter the Order's plot was foiled, Jade and Topaz met with Oti Alfalfa, who was now the figurehead of the family following Sunday's arrest for his role in the plot. Oti reveals his plan to keep the IPC from acquiring Penacony, but Jade informs him that the IPC could crush his plan in an instant now that \"death\" was a reality in the Dreamscape. Jade gave him a counteroffer in that the IPC would not interfere with the Family's interests in return for some shares to rebuild the planet. Oti ultimately agreed to her offer, and Jade gave some of the shares to the Astral Express for their role in stopping the plot.[20]\nWhile the acquisition of Penacony was successful and swayed the vote of another board member, Aventurine was held punishable for the destruction of his Cornerstone. Diamond called the Ten Stonehearts to vote on Aventurine's fate, and Pearl was assigned chair of the meeting. In the end, Sugilite, Obsidian, Agate (represented by Obsidian) and Sapphire (represented by Pearl) voted to punish Aventurine while Topaz, Jade, Pearl, Amber (also represented by Pearl) and Opal chose to restore his position. With the majority of votes in favor, Aventurine's position was restored and his Cornerstone repaired.[6]\n"

They are categorized as Kingdom Spiritual Organisms, Class Astral Spirits, Order Shapeless, and are known for their mischievous nature.[2]\nAccording to Adler's Tier System, Wubbaboos fall under the medium containment level.\nThe concept of spiritual organisms represented by Astral Spirits can be traced back to the recorded beginnings of the Amber Era. The Leviathan's Conception Theory suggests that some elder Leviathans were stranded after the Dusk Wars, and during their long sleep, their decomposed cells became the seedbed for organic organisms while their dissipating life force became wandering Astral Spirits. However, recent studies have denounced this theory, and more research is needed to determine the exact origin of Astral Spirits.[2]\nInitially, Astral Spirits were aimless and lacked individual will. However, during the Trailblaze, as humans began to travel through the galaxy, the Astral Spirits became attracted to their freedom of travel. The Astral Spirits were drawn to human emotions, particularly love and lust, and would possess the bodies of those who emitted strong emotions. Those who were unable to merge with the Astral Spirits died on the spot. However, some individuals managed to form a symbiotic relationship with the Astral Spirits. These spirits were feared for their exceptional abilities to sense emotions and control people's hearts and minds.[2]\nWubbaboos have inherited the abilities of their Astral Spirit ancestors, albeit on a less deadly scale. They enjoy scaring people and appear as ghostly, semi-transparent, shifting forms. Once they attach themselves to a host, the personality of the host changes dramatically, and their behavior becomes completely altered. They commit a series of pranks, and after they get bored, the host regains consciousness.[2]\nA singular Wubbaboo possesses the intelligence of a six-year-old human, although this comparison is based on a test sample consisting of Adler and Wen Shiling. When in a group, the Wubbaboos' individual intelligence reduces dramatically. This is because the thought waves of spiritual organisms interfere with each other, and a resonance in frequency will affect their individual decision-making.[3]\n"

        "content": "Cocolia Rand was the eighteenth Supreme Guardian of Belobog and the adoptive mother of Bronya Rand. Having been corrupted by the Stellaron on Jarilo-VI, Cocolia plotted to destroy Belobog in the belief that doing so would allow her to create a new world, but was defeated by the Trailblazer and died after the Fragmentum energy of the Stellaron overwhelmed her.[4]\nCocolia is the antagonist of the Belobog Trailblaze Missions.\nCocolia was born in Belobog, the artificial city created by Alisa Rand, her ancestor. She grew up in the Underworld, and after being selected as heir to the guardianship and moving to the Overworld, she would often visit the florist to see flowers she couldn't see in the Underworld.[5] As a teenager, Cocolia studied at Belobog Military Academy with a major in military history, where she met and befriended a young Serval.[6] She graduated top of her class and was said to be the most brilliant mind in all of Belobog.[5] After becoming the Supreme Guardian, she also adopted a young Bronya from an orphanage in the Underworld.[7]\nDuring her term in office, young Cocolia was tormented by the calls of the Stellaron in her planet, Jarilo-VI, which gave her premonitions of destruction and devastation that would come to pass unless she cooperated with its wishes to destroy the planet in order to rebuild it in her image.[8] At least 10 years before the Astral Express crew arrive on Jarilo-VI, Cocolia decided to block off all access to the Underworld, leaving only the Geomarrow transport line as a means of connection.\nThe mental damage Cocolia suffered from the Stellaron constantly tormenting her with promises of a better future became too much for her to handle, shaking her will and faith in the Preservation. This made her lose hope that Belobog would ever become prosperous, which led her to worship the Stellaron instead.[9] Cocolia became disillusioned, distant, and very far from what Serval described her young self as, a person who was passionate about what she did and loved her home to the point that she'd sacrifice her own dreams for the sake of making it better.[4]\nSometime after her death, her phantom leads Fragmentum Monsters to invade the Underworld. The invasion is stopped by the Silvermane Guards who have returned to the Underworld for the first time since the blockade, and her phantom is defeated by the Trailblazer, Serval, and Gepard.[10]\nDuring the event Everwinter City Museum Ledger of Curiosities, Bronya commissioned a portrait of Cocolia for exhibition in the History and Culture Museum, and asks the Trailblazer for advice on the portrait's introduction.[5] Depending on the player's choice, Cocolia will get the title \"The Martyr/Hurried/Callous\".[11]\n"

        "session_name": "Fragmentum",
        "url": "https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com//wiki/Fragmentum",
        "content": "The Fragmentum is the corrosion of Stellarons on the local environment. It corrupts living beings, as seen in Cloud Knights on The Xianzhou Luofu, and spawns various enemies. Anything that comes into contact with the Fragmentum will be turned into Fragmentum creations.[1] The Caverns of Corrosion, Calyxes, and Stagnant Shadows are objects created by the Fragmentum. The Fragmentum started spreading in 2147 AE and is still spreading presently in 2158 AE.\nChunks of Fragmentum accumulated on a surface (such as walls and buildings) are called Fragmentum Corrosion, and can be easily identified by its black and gold colors. All existing Fragmentum spaces are connected, which is how monsters can enter areas with Fragmentum Corrosion.[1]\nRelics are items created from the Fragmentum, and Relic Remains are broken parts of these relics that are nearly a step away from dissolving into Lost Lightdust. Lost Lightdust can be used to upgrade Relics, and can condense into larger Lost Gold Fragments and Lost Crystals. Lost Crystals are nearly identical to the crystal shed by the Aeon of Preservation, Qlipoth, and it is stressed to avoid offering these by accident as they go against the Aeon's beliefs.[2]\nFragmentum-created monsters generally have a habit of destroying human-made objects, though some Fragmentum monsters can be seen guarding them, and some have higher intellect than others. Monsters created by the Fragmentum tend to model themselves after the Stellaron's surroundings, as shown in Belobog where many of these enemies resemble Automatons, the Silvermane Guards, and even former Supreme Guardians. Those who die in Fragmentum-affected areas with particularly strong emotions can remain as Echoes, retaining some of the traits they had while living. These Echoes are generally more intelligent and can lead other Fragmentum monsters into battle.\nWhile people can use Fragmentum-tainted equipment, doing so is ill-advised and will eventually cause death.[3] Machines that attempt to use Framgentum-tainted equipment will also find themselves corrupted, though their inorganic nature prevents them from being destroyed. In the case of automatons, their fellow automatons on the base network will consider them an enemy due to the Fragmentum's taint.[4]\nWhen Stellaron Hunters Kafka and Silver Wolf extracted the Stellaron from Herta's collection, it corroded the space station and formed the Fragmentum throughout.[1]\nThe presence of the Stellaron on Jarilo-VI caused the Eternal Freeze, resulting in Fragmentum spreading across the planet. To protect the Overworld, the Supreme Guardian and The Architects sent civilians underground and sealed it off in order to protect them, leaving behind various automatons for their protection. Despite this, the Fragmentum was able to seep underground, resulting in several towns becoming abandoned due to the danger of the monsters. The people of Belobog have been fighting the Fragmentum for roughly 700 years on a losing scale.\nWhen the Astral Express arrived on the planet, they were able to seal the Stellaron, stopping the Eternal Freeze and the Fragmentum from spreading as aggressively, though the Stellaron's long duration on the planet meant that the Fragmentum was unlikely to disappear in the short-term.\nThe presence of a Stellaron on the Xianzhou Luofu caused the Ambrosial Arbor to revive itself, leading to the conclusion that a Stellaron does not need to be on a planet to cause corruption, turning Cloud Knights into mara-struck entities. Some Fragmentum creatures also manifested on the ship, primarily in Cloudford.\nAfter defeating the mastermind behind the chaos, the Astral Express sealed the Stellaron.\nA Stellaron Crisis on Penacony resulted in the IPC losing control of the former prison planet. The Stellaron was eventually sealed by the Astral Express.\n"

Rivet Town was one such place destroyed by the effects of the Stellaron, and survivors were forced to move elsewhere.\nNatasha, who was forced to abandon her orphanage to make sure she could stay alive and treat her patients, realized that without action, their situation would not improve.

When Argenti reveals his plan to jump out of the Express and stab the Giant Sting, Velite offers to go with him, but Argenti insists that he remain on the Express. Velite, concerned for Argenti's fate, tells him not to die and that he'll be waiting for him to come back.[1]\nShortly after the Express is ejected out of the Giant Sting's stomach, Velite departs. He ends up reuniting with Argenti at some point in the future. It turned out that the last True Sting was hiding inside Velite's armor and giving him hallucinations of piloting the \"One and Only\". After Argenti defeats the insect, Velite gives up on the idea of using Argenti as an IPC spokesperson, and decides to pursue his old dream of being a pilot.[1]\n"
