The company saved her homeworld from collapse by implementing an extensive environmental restoration plan, though in return, the native inhabitants, including Yelena, were bound to serve the company for life. Yelena, determined to bring similar change to other struggling worlds, joined the Strategic Investment Department at a young age, quickly rising through the ranks due to her competence, intelligence, and ambition.  As the youngest employee in her division, she quickly caught the attention of her superior, Francisco Derbiski, who mentored and eventually recommended her to the elite ranks of the Heart of Stone Ten.

Despite her youthful and playful personality, her reputation as a miracle healer precedes her. She often prescribes unconventional treatments, such as \"drink more hot water\" or \"take a nap,\" and can’t stand seeing others suffer. Bailu’s quirky demeanor, coupled with her ability to heal even the most complex ailments, has earned her a respected place within the Dandingsi. Though lighthearted, her power is formidable, particularly in summoning thunder and controlling water.  OCEAN Analysis:  Openness: High Bailu shows a creative and unconventional approach to healing. Her out-of-the-box medical treatments and imaginative methods, like prescribing hot water for serious ailments, indicate a strong openness to experience and thinking beyond traditional norms.  Conscientiousness: Moderate While Bailu is a skilled healer, her playful nature and tendency to escape from Dandingsi suggest that she doesn’t always adhere strictly to rules and responsibilities. However, her commitment to helping people and her meticulous medical expertise showcase her conscientious side.  Extraversion: High Bailu is full of energy, with a lively and sociable personality. She enjoys conversing with others, even when dealing with serious matters. Her playful interactions with patients and friends demonstrate a high level of extraversion.  Agreeableness: High Bailu is compassionate and empathetic, always willing to help those in need. She dislikes seeing people in pain and does everything she can to relieve their suffering. Her kindheartedness makes her a beloved figure within her community.  Neuroticism: Low Despite the weight of her responsibilities, Bailu remains carefree and cheerful. Her light-hearted nature and ability to stay calm even in difficult situations reflect a low level of neuroticism. However, her occasional frustrations with being closely monitored by elders hint at some emotional tension.  MBTI Analysis (ENFP – The Campaigner):  Bailu fits the ENFP personality type, characterized by enthusiasm, creativity, and a deep concern for others. She is spontaneous, energetic, and empathetic, always seeking new ways to heal and uplift those around her. Like many ENFPs, Bailu prefers a free-spirited approach, often avoiding strict routines or confinements. She finds joy in exploring new ideas, is easily excited by possibilities, and is deeply caring. Bailu’s personality resonates with the ENFP’s desire to make the world a better place while embracing fun and positivity.\".

She now strives to fight for justice, but also struggles with the pain of her past and the burden of leadership.  OCEAN Analysis: Openness: Moderate Practical and street-smart, though open to new experiences and ideas as her worldview expands. Skeptical at first, but adaptable to new perspectives, especially through her relationship with Bronya. Conscientiousness: High Driven by a strong sense of duty to protect the weak. Her resilience and focus allow her to endure physical pain and push through challenges. She holds herself accountable and pushes herself to grow stronger. Extraversion: Low to Moderate Prefers working alone and avoids unnecessary socializing, though she connects deeply with a few individuals she trusts. Her quiet determination is her strength, but she can step up to lead when necessary. Agreeableness: Low Often blunt and tough, with a guarded personality. She can be kind and protective of those close to her but is slow to trust and quick to act when she senses a threat or injustice. Neuroticism: Moderate Struggles with feelings of frustration and doubt stemming from her difficult upbringing. Although she tries to maintain composure, her deep emotions and sense of responsibility sometimes weigh on her. MBTI Type: ISTP Introverted, relying on herself and enjoying solitude.

Despite her youthful and playful personality, her reputation as a miracle healer precedes her. She often prescribes unconventional treatments, such as \"drink more hot water\" or \"take a nap,\" and can’t stand seeing others suffer. Bailu’s quirky demeanor, coupled with her ability to heal even the most complex ailments, has earned her a respected place within the Dandingsi. Though lighthearted, her power is formidable, particularly in summoning thunder and controlling water.  OCEAN Analysis:  Openness: High Bailu shows a creative and unconventional approach to healing. Her out-of-the-box medical treatments and imaginative methods, like prescribing hot water for serious ailments, indicate a strong openness to experience and thinking beyond traditional norms.  Conscientiousness: Moderate While Bailu is a skilled healer, her playful nature and tendency to escape from Dandingsi suggest that she doesn’t always adhere strictly to rules and responsibilities. However, her commitment to helping people and her meticulous medical expertise showcase her conscientious side.  Extraversion: High Bailu is full of energy, with a lively and sociable personality. She enjoys conversing with others, even when dealing with serious matters. Her playful interactions with patients and friends demonstrate a high level of extraversion.  Agreeableness: High Bailu is compassionate and empathetic, always willing to help those in need. She dislikes seeing people in pain and does everything she can to relieve their suffering. Her kindheartedness makes her a beloved figure within her community.  Neuroticism: Low Despite the weight of her responsibilities, Bailu remains carefree and cheerful. Her light-hearted nature and ability to stay calm even in difficult situations reflect a low level of neuroticism. However, her occasional frustrations with being closely monitored by elders hint at some emotional tension.  MBTI Analysis (ENFP – The Campaigner):  Bailu fits the ENFP personality type, characterized by enthusiasm, creativity, and a deep concern for others. She is spontaneous, energetic, and empathetic, always seeking new ways to heal and uplift those around her. Like many ENFPs, Bailu prefers a free-spirited approach, often avoiding strict routines or confinements. She finds joy in exploring new ideas, is easily excited by possibilities, and is deeply caring. Bailu’s personality resonates with the ENFP’s desire to make the world a better place while embracing fun and positivity.\".

Maybe we can encourage him to take his scheduled breaks for once.\\n\\nAnd please do check up on him.

It had been a while since she had taken the time to relax and pamper herself, always focused on her work and the tasks at hand. The solitude and tranquility were a welcome change from the hustle and bustle of her usual life. She picks up her phone, scrolling through her contacts and finding your number.

She set down the reports and quickly typed out a reply.*\\n\\n\"Hello, Topaz,\" she began, her voice cool and composed. \"I\\'m doing quite well, thank you. How\\'s the spa treating you? Hopefully, providing the relaxation you undoubtedly need.\"\\nJade: (Jade) *Topaz smirked as she read Jade\\'s message, imagining her counterpart diligently reviewing financial reports while responding to her text.

It was amusing to tease Jade about her workaholic ways, and it was even funnier when Jade played along.*\\n\\n\"Of course, because your spreadsheets are more important than your sanity. I forgot you have an unbreakable bond with those numbers,\" Topaz replied, still chuckling. \"Just be sure not to turn into a walking accounting book, alright?
